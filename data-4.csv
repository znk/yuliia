0,Chyi Chin,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/chyi-chin-lyrics.html,如果雲知道 (Rú guǒ yún zhī dào),https://lyricstranslate.com/en/%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E9%9B%B2%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93-if-only-clouds-knew.html,"愛一旦結冰　一切都好平靜
淚水它一旦流盡　只剩決心
放逐自己在黑夜的邊境
任由黎明一步一步向我逼近
想你的心　化成灰燼 真的有點累了　沒什麼力氣
有太多太多回憶　哽住呼吸
愛你的心我無處投遞 如果可以飛簷走壁找到你
愛的委屈　不必澄清
只要你將我抱緊 如果雲知道　想你的夜慢慢熬
每個思念過一秒　每次呼喊過一秒
只覺得生命不停燃燒 如果雲知道　逃不開糾纏的牢
每當心痛過一秒　每回哭醒過一秒
只剩下心在乞討　你不會知道 ","Once love is frozen, it's quiet all around.
Once tears run dry, only resolution remains.
I banish myself to the edge of the dark night
and make no struggle as the dawn is approaching me step by step.
My heart that's yearning for you has burned down into ashes. I really feel a bit tired now and I don't have any strength.
Too many memories choke my breath.
I have nowhere to send you my heart that's loving you. If I can fly over roofs and climb the walls to find you,
it's not even necessary to clarify the wrong I feel in loving you.
It'll be just fine if you hold me tight. If only the clouds knew how I suffer during the long night when I miss you.
For one second I miss you, for another I yell out loud.
I just feel that my life keeps burning. If only the clouds knew that I can't escape from this jail that's tangling up my mind.
For one second my heart aches, for another I wake up crying.
The only thing that remains is my begging heart, but you will never know. ",lakoje,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lakoje

也从不会为一个人如此心碎

在那凄风苦雨中晃曳彷徨 但是希望你明白 我就在你身旁
无论你在多远的地方
即使你变了模样 即使你把我遗忘
你永远都是我心爱的姑娘 愿上苍为你指引平坦的道路
愿命运让你遇见善良的人们
愿远方的阳光和璀璨的灯火
为你照亮每一片未来的天空 时光就象一条奔腾的河流
将生命中的一切悄悄带走
而我的心就象那翻涌的浪花
永远陪着你哪怕是海角天涯 从此希望你明白 我就在你身旁
无论你在多远的地方
直到你变了模样 直到你把我遗忘
你依然会是我心爱的姑娘 真的希望你知道 我就在你身旁
无论你在多远的地方
直到我去了天堂 直到你把我遗忘
你依然会是我心爱的姑娘
你依然会是我心爱的姑娘 ","I never make any promises,
[And] my heart never breaks so much for a person.
But now I can open my heart wide,
[Because] you are my only truly beloved girl. But suddenly, one day, you left here,
[You] took the whole whole world, without leaving a cloud.
After that, I was like barley which was pulled away from the wheat,
Swaying about, hesitating in the bleak wind and icy rain. But I hope you understand that I'll be by your side,
No matter how far you are.
Even if you changed your appearance, even if you forget me,
You will forever be my beloved girl. I wish that the heavens would guide you on a smooth road,
[And] I wish that destiny will let you meet warm-hearted people.
I wish that the faraway sunlight and the bright lights
Light every part of the sky for you in the future. Time is like a surging river,
Quietly taking everything with it.
But my heart is like a surging spray,
Forever accompanying you to the ends of the earth. After that, I hope you understand that I'll be by your side,
No matter how far you are.
Until you change your appearance, until you forget me,
You are still my beloved girl. I really hope you know that I'll be by your side,
No matter how far you are.
Until I go to heaven, until you forget me,
You are still my beloved girl.
You are still my beloved girl. ",Elda Mengisto,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/elda-mengisto

My life is full of ups and downs like sea wave
against all insults and wrongs, I will smile
I get low I will get high
I am shaking but I won't topple down
the truth about the drunken, I know all (verse 2)
I never use the sword to fight for my fame on this big world
i can take all heavy chains and burdens on my shoulders
I never shout my grievance and plead/beg for mercy
I can stoop in order to help my friends
Be the drunken master, Be a good man (verse 3)
Stop talking about the craziness, the Madmen are really very kind-hearted.
Stop laughing at the frenzy/hysteria/ecstasy, cos it's hard to find the mad heart
Stop fearing of the drunk, I got drunken and got high-spirit
we dare to be crazy, mad and drunken when we are young ( repeat verse 1) (rap)
Bottom up
Stand strong, take it easy
only drink a little, don't sneak out
Hit tiger with board, chicken eats worm

I know in my heart I am a hero ( repeat verse 2)

Thousands of people at three in the afternoon jump out of line
In 1960's, European avant-garde independent directors had seminars
90's idols made a comeback, giving signatures, handshakes and hugs
Expedition in the -50 degrees Artic Circle lasts for more than ten days
Scorching heat in the Sahara being a mind-blowing ordeal of survival
Venting feelings hysterically at a KTV bar for three days and two nights
Listen to a melancholy song to relax, fall asleep and hypnotize unconsciously
A string of passwords falls into the virtual generation
Having fun while shopping online
Can't help taking selfies cause I'm so handsome
Photoshop, forward, comment and click like
Doesn't matter whether you're real or not, I just play
Doesn't matter whether it is 15 seconds or my whole life, I just play
Doesn't matter whether you remember my face or not, I just play
I play, play'em all, play'em all
Favoring everything (everything) and mastering everything
Favoring everything (everything) and mastering everything
Favoring everything (everything) and mastering everything
Play'em all, play'em all
Play'em all, play'em all
Play'em all, play'em all
Play'em all, play'em all
Dating with my handsome boyfriend on Wednesday afternoon
Getting him mesmerized with my cute outfits
Reading Hemingway at a 24-hour laundromat on Fridays
Not feeling tired at all about my 50 anonymous accounts on the İnternet
Passcode switches to the real word
Went to you and gave everything I had
Elimination through selection and competition, that's what we do on stage
Beat all the opponents just to remember one face
Doesn't matter whether you love me or not, I just play
Doesn't matter whether you clap for me or you admire my beauty, I just play
I just enjoy my own performance, I play
I play, play'em all, play'em all

心都快蹦出来了头发也被吹乱
什么叫 Counting down now, four, three, two, one
我勇往直前
但其实我也来不及转弯 怕我会把航线图弄反
才一直追不上地球的运转
撇开所有害怕 It's alright so far
曾幼稚的脸庞
这些日子已经逐渐长大 假如光年之外的恒星
闪烁依然那么有恒心
每次推进都算在前进

I'll still smile
Until my dream is shooting quickly towards success

The dizzy feeling of gliding
Heart's about to burst out, hair's messed up
What is called counting down now four three two one
I bravely go forward
But I almost miss a turn Scared I'll screw up the route
So I've never caught up while chasing the rotation of Earth
Swiping away all fears it's alright so far
The once childish look
Growing up as the days have gone past If a star beyond the years
Still shining as brightly
Then every push is a step forward ready yeah
If youth is the reason
Then the fuel for aspiration is passion

I'm still learning how to control
Shooting my dreams straight into the faraway universe
If I lose my way
I'll still smile
Until my dream is shooting quickly towards success
Oh yeah yeah What is bravery
Is it not being fearful
Is it being weightless
Accidentally knocking your sense of direction
When can I land on the world's peak
But that's okay cause
The me youy understand is not lonely You're here to give me courage any time
Let's keep up the good work
The road's smoother yeah
Expressing my own goals and views
Arriving wherever I want to go
Brushing my shoulders Want to become the guiding star
Increasing my perseverance to work hard
Every push should also be a step forward ready yeah
Youth is the blueprint for you and I
The plans for our aspirations become more sreamline
That's the deal we'll make ooh baby The galaxy is swaying
I'm still learning how to control
Shooting my dreams straight into the faraway universe
If I lose my way
I'll still smile
Until my dream is hooting quickly towards success
Oh yeah yeah Despite laughing I'm dreaming
Are you thinking what I'm thinking
If it's dream why are my memories messily new
Testing my abilities
Using my new attitude
Waiting for the empty sky to finish all my waiting
Wanting to live Flying in the sky
No I should say
The galaxy can also be moved
I'll take control of my future
Shooting my dreams straight into the faraway universe
Never idling in any second
The cold air while flying
Can't wipe off my smile
Until my dream is shooting quickly towards success
I'll never find an excuse for buffering Oh yeah yeah
Here we go here we go fire
Here it goes here it goes higher
Little bit higher
Oh oh ay oh oh ay
Just a little bit

Of each comet
Ignoring the indifferent crowds
With binoculars on

Saying you are wrong
Your ideas are wrong
No sparkle in me
Save your nonsense

Ignore others’ blabbing

Breaks the shackles on mind  Take everything away  Your cold-bloodiness

飞向那遥远的彼岸 ","Remember how we once were your travel companions?
We were intimately familiar with every note in the gamut of human emotions
That journey of a thousand miles would eventually come to a final farewell
The celestial world above and the human world below
Then treated one another with mutual respect
You would still have frequent flashbacks
Of Kinnara and Gandharva
The two destined lovers
Soaring into the sky Now we are about to return to the walls of those caves
Return to another world You must believe that
By the end, I will be living in another time period
As such, not a single soul will truly
Bid you farewell
That means you simply need not be mired in perpetual sorrow
Nor be tormented by regret
Perhaps only departure alone
Can make you understand what it means to pine for someone You will discover that
We have always
Been living in another time period
In fact, not a single soul truly
Has the ability to bid you farewell
Thus there’s no use talking about anguish
Of course, lamenting is yet even more futile
After all, only departure alone
Can teach you how it feels to yearn for someone Go ahead and try, just close your eyes
You will discover, materializing out of thin air,
That shade, barely perceptible,
Yet permeates deep into your bones
Go ahead and try, just close your eyes
You will hear
That sound, faintly discernible,
Yet turns out to be an unmistakable call out Who is there
Seeking for some warmth on this wintry night?
Who is there
Arduously trekking through formidable mountains?
Who is there
Silently recounting those times of old?
Who is there
Wordlessly pouring forth a flood of questions?
Whose body has been eroded away by the undulating sea of yellow sand?
Whose beauty has been stained with age by the years?
Who has time and time again blurred your eyes with tears?
And stirred up the intangible that can only be viscerally sensed? No one ever dares
Who would truly dare
To yearn and love through eternity?
From now on
Everything still remains at this very place
Everything is already long gone
Yet, at this moment, just lift your head
And you will discover with your own eyes
We have now reached the dome of the cave
The Nine Heavens, in their glorious immensity When our fingertips are lifted
When our bodies are reversed
When our fingertips are lifted
When our bodies are reversed
Within a ksana (A ksana shivers)
The heartstrings of the entire universe Silk threads spun forth
Like a dangling Milky Way
Stars twinkling
Like a sprinkling rain of flowers
Would you be willing
To let me take you along and soar high
To flutter and glide
Towards that distant veil of clouds Soar, soar, soar, soar into the sky
Away from the immense sufferings of this world
Soar, soar, soar, soar into the sky
Away from the excruciating fetters of this world
Soar, soar, soar, soar into the sky
Towards an eternal nirvana

I open the book you left
And spend all night alone.
I pour a glass of wine and pour out my heart.
Although I often do in this way
I cut people off in mid-sentence who pour the soul before me. Saying good night one last time,
I'll get used to it in the future.
The more I put in my efforts without expecting anything in return,
The more I realize how difficult it is.
Saying good night the last time,
Let the end be natural.
Just being in an empty room, I don't know what to do. I trying to comprehend from the beginning
That love has a beginning and an end.
I'll try to hold back the tears, at least in the end.
I can be touched alone.
After all, I have completely given everything that I had.
Now I have to step back.
However, I remember our feelings again and again.
Why is this happening over and over again? I trying to comprehend from the beginning.
If love has just begun, how can it end immediately?
First, you look with a smile, and then you look around in bewilderment.
This is also a kind of journey.
A gift that cannot be given
Is covered in dust as a result.
Loving with all my heart, I should be more modest,
Only then, I will not seem rude. Saying good night one last time,

A life thrown away to fall short of this dream. He no longer talks about the isle to meet,
when the heart is a barren waste,
that can't even fit a house,
only to be mute to lie to no one else. All of your acclaimed vanity, he said,
are dwarfed by the first sight.
The rivers of time all wither and sigh.
When Pangea overtakes the continents,
he'd embrace you after a journey of life.
Drunken in the dreams, he says goodnight.  He heard someone's old ballads,
of what still happens far away,
like the isle in his eyes,
void of sadness or blossom. When the Southern sun gleams on you, with a blizzard howling;
When the Northern night engulfs me, in this year-long spring;

命中註定是你 張：慾望將心磨去稜角
嘲笑溫情從不勝仗 我偏要做這野火燒不盡的糧
把愛餵養 合：站在巨浪的中心風是我思想
雨是催馬還擊的獵場 抬頭遙望那些回不去的時光
眼前的火炬在激盪 天越來越黑 路越來越長
我知道人心不能搖晃 敢亂世為王 必擲血屠狼
才有希望 張：夢裡有過渴望
醒來卻容不得淚千行 趙：曾經暗度陳倉
如今正面對抗 不接受命運的盤問
愛恨教我以柔克剛 張：付出血的代價還要一顆心臟
寸寸償 合：站在巨浪的中心風是我思想
雨是催馬還擊的獵場 抬頭遙望那些回不去的時光
眼前的火炬在激盪 天越來越黑 路越來越長
我知道人心不能搖晃 敢亂世為王 必擲血屠狼
才有希望 趙：荊棘之上仰望的人
會看透風塵 張：在這善惡彼伏的城
我與你共存 合：穿過刀山越過火海把愛信仰
一顆真心有一片天堂 生如蜉蝣卻要活得蕩氣迴腸
相信前方就是故鄉 我抬頭仰望這荊棘之上
大地的力量終將被釋放 看萬物生長看日月滄桑
為你守望 ","ZBC：People who look up from the thorns
can see through anything. I will stay with you
in this complicated city. ZLY：That sharp beam
instructs me to pass through sadness. That encounter tells that
we are meant to be. ZBC：Desire roughs the angles of heart
and teases that warmth never wins. I have to be the undefeated grain
for nourishing love. All：I stand at the centre of the waves. My thoughts are wind.
The hunting ground is rain. I look up and remember those unreturnable days.
The torch is shaking vigorously before me. The sky becomes darker and the road becomes longer.
I understand that I have to be the leader. I dare to be the king of the riots by attacking the enemies.
So, our hope can come true. ZBC：I have the desire in my dream.
When I awake, I know that I have to be tough. ZLY：I hid in the dark side.
Now, I go head-to-head. I don't believe in fate.
The experience told me to kill with kindness. ZBC：I use my blood and my heart
as the cost. All：I stand at the centre of the waves. My thoughts are wind.
The hunting ground is rain. I look up and remember those unreturnable days.
The torch is shaking vigorously before me. The sky becomes darker and the road becomes longer.

So, our hope can come true. ZLY：People who look up from the thorns
can see through anything. ZBC：I will stay with you
in this complicated city. All：Passing through blades, fire and believe in love.
A sincere heart can lead to heaven. I came from a slave family but I have to live well.
I believe that ahead is the hometown. I look up from the thorns
and the power of land will be released. I look at things growing and time goes by.
I guard for you. ",secantt,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/secantt

In the end, I was always waiting
We keep a polite distance in our speech
But the atmosphere isn't warming up
Our love is running out of stock
You're saying this with such a serious tone
as if I purposefully brush you off
This old plot, like patterned and insincere trickery
palely enter the stage
Does separation require lingering affection,
to avoid seeming too player-like?
Take everything you want,
void all the memory
Don't care about feelings
It's dignified and reserved
The words I said, they're freebies that you can keep
I don't need to compromise for you any longer
Saying an excuse for breakup
Once, twice, three times
Until the end, when nothing allows one to win the argument
Les mots d'amour are just lies that we make good once in a while
We used to love in a greedy manner
Now we need to leave the past some dignity
Since we've decided to break up, let's not do goodbye by death by a thousand cuts
Take everything you want
I will deal with and bear the rest
Leave our dog with me
Don't ask if he makes a difference

Like a stubborn kite chasing the wind.
Against the light against the rain.

Lend me a corner.
Lend me light and fire.
Lend me a song.
Ask the cold river to borrow the spray.
Lend me a warm pulse.
Even the desolate marsh.
Lend me a hand to hold.
Let the snow fall on the heart. Lend me a small eaves to hide.
Look sad into a river.
Starry night sky which one is mine,
My flashing firefly.
Lend me to illuminate me.
Let the darkness become colored.
Let the cold change warm. Wait until the snow blows.

If I were to be queen at the next station, that would be great.
But on the road to stardom, if suddenly I become scared of heights,
Would he still hug me from behind? The lovers on Paterson Street are brimming with pride.
It might not be better to be allowed to sing freely on stage.
Fame, like soap bubbles, quickly disappears. Even if I one day have a concert, he who wants to sing won't be able to get to the venue.
Still, I feel like I have lived in vain. If I don't love, how can I sing?
How can I sing all of the love songs? How can I light up the stage?
It's so different than singing tenderly to my loved one. My daydreams of flying aren't too far, they aren't too abstract.
In the end, I become the queen, and I become the bride. These are my dreams.
In Times Square, everyone wins an award.
Even if I don't have any fans, I have him to admire me. The lovers on Paterson Street are brimming with pride.

Goodbye to my troubles, I’m lonely no more.
​Goodbye to my weakness, I cry no more.

Hello hello
My future! In the endless night,
When all has been destroyed,
At least I can still dream,
And can still be touched by you.
It turns out the beginning of dawn,
Comes from within my heart,
And that as long as I can dream,
I'm able to see the rainbow,
Shining in my sky. Hardships and departures are but a part of life,
Only after many years did I understand my family’s tears.
I realized I did not have the courage to say goodbye,
The sentimental atmosphere of leaving, has affected the air of the whole city
You don't know what you've got until it's gone,
I wonder if my friends have already spread their wings to take flight,
Without flying to new heights, how can we see the whole world?
You have grown up, now go tell the world! ​The outside world is magnetic,
Tempting every pair of wings preparing to take flight,
The fire of passion burns fiercely in each infatuated couple,
Beautiful sparks surround the lovers.
The journey is beautiful, despite its frustrations and disappointments,
Fully opened our hearts to love, even if the one she loved wasn’t me.
Without departure, how would we learn resilience?
​Without falling down, how would we learn to get back up? In the endless night,
When all has been destroyed,
At least I can still dream,
And can still be touched by you.
It turns out the beginning of dawn,
Comes from within my heart,
And that as long as I can dream,
I'm able to see the rainbow,
​Shining in my sky. Hello hello, who's waiting for me?
Hello hello, in that mysterious future
Hello hello, finding the love that belongs to me
This is my new life, who's waiting for me
In that mysterious future
Finding the love that belongs to me In the endless night,
When all has been destroyed,
At least I can still dream,
And can still be touched by you.
It turns out the beginning of dawn,
Comes from within my heart,
And that as long as I can dream,
I'm able to see the rainbow,
​Shining in my sky. In the endless night,
When all has been destroyed,
At least I can still dream,
And can still be touched by you.

来不及 赋予它旅途的意义 若一切 都已云烟成雨
我能否 变成淤泥
再一次 沾染你
若生命 如过场电影
Oh 让我再一次 甜梦里惊醒 我多想再见你
哪怕匆匆一眼就别离
路灯下昏黄的剪影
越走越漫长的林径 我多想再见你
至少玩笑话还能说起
街巷初次落叶的秋分
渐行渐远去的我们 若一切 都已云烟成雨

想念是你的声音
我们提着过去 走入人群
寻找著一个位置 安放自己 我多想再见你

路灯下昏黄的剪影
越走越漫长的林径 我多想再见你
至少玩笑话还能说起

I stayed into the night to treat the fantasy of my insomnia
That handwritten letter remained at the bottom of the suitcase
It's too late to endow it with the meaning of our journey If all has turned with the smog into rain
Could I become the silt
To taint you once again?
If life is like a passing movie
Oh, let me wake up from this fantasy again. I want to see you again so much
Even a hurried glance before you leave
The yellowed papercut silhouette under the streetlamps
The forest path that only grows longer with each step I want to see you again so much
Even to banter again about old jokes
The autumn's first leaves in the streets
And our slow parting, our slow drifting away. If all has turned with the smog into rain
Could I become the silt
To taint you once again?
If life is like a passing movie
Oh, let me wake up from this fantasy again. I want to see you again so much
Even a hurried glance before you leave
The yellowed papercut silhouette under the streetlamps
The forest path that only grows longer with each step I want to see you again so much
Even to banter again about old jokes
The autumn's first leaves in the streets
And our slow parting, our slow drifting away. The whistle of the railway platform sounds
But your voice is what I'm missing
We carry the past with us into the crowd
Looking for a place to make our home I want to see you again so much
Even a hurried glance before you leave
The yellowed papercut silhouette under the streetlamps
The forest path that only grows longer with each step I want to see you again so much
Even to banter again about old jokes
The autumn's first leaves in the streets
And our slow parting, our slow drifting away. ",Semyon Mark,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/semyon-mark

Still tasty when it passes by my throat;

Where remains tenderness.

I understand he/she's trekking wind and rain and overlooks every sunset coming to him/her.
Spanning the crowds, he/she just desires to embrace you.
At this moment, moon is high in the sky whilst your beloved one's holding the starlight in hands.
I comprehend he/she's gone to the darkness through gusts and surges.
My empathy will render you the redemption and eager hope.
Though I know you can't, I still want you to feel;
Adding several pieces of rainbow to the starlight,
Making sakura kiss your forehead secretly,
Let all fine things of the world interlock with you.

I finally learnt how to love, after
And yet, you've long disappeared in the sea of people.
I finally understood in my tears, after
Some people you miss and they're gone forever. White Gardenia petals
Fell gently on my blue pleated skirt.
I love you, you said softly
And I lowered my head into a fragrant wave. That everlasting night,
Seventeen in Midsummer.
That was the night you kissed me.
And ever since,
Every time I sigh,
I recall the starlight from that night. How was love then
so simple?
And why is it that, in our youth
We always end up hurting those we deeply love?
And in this deep night that was like that night,
are you too, like me, reminiscing silently—chasing sentimentality?
And if we were less stubborn then,
would we be having less regrets now? How do you remember me?
With similes or in silence?
And in all the years since,
has anyone taken your loneliness away? [Chorus]

Blow, blow, I'm not afraid to be barefoot.
Blow, blow, it doesn't matter, disturb me.

You see I'm bravely waving. How the wind is harder, the stronger my heart is
I'm going to be a giant.

愛情到底是怎麼從美麗慢慢凋零 每一個夜晚我都還夢見你

月亮會一直帶領
往幸福的路徑

說你會一直愛我 夢裡鮮紅的薔薇

紀念著曾經最真摯的愛 記憶裡快樂再真切

就算真的勇敢地說出口

Even I myself am surprised
Facing the most familiar you
What was once the most familiar you
And I am actually this scared
I can't say, can you not go
Can't keep the gentleness you once had for me
Right now with my disturbed heart
Your forced expression
How exactly did the beauty of love slowly wither
Every night I still dream of you
And see my naive self
And remember how we believed then
That the moon will always lead
The path to happiness
The moon also heard you say
Say that you will always love me
The bright red rose in my dreams
Is a pale white rose when I open my eyes
It lies under the moon
Commemorating what was once the truest love
No matter how sincere happiness was in memories
It freezes in the cold air
And right now under the moon
There's only a solitary grave
Guarding the love that died
I don't, I don't know why
You did not show one bit of lingering
Facing the unfamiliar you
The unfamiliar you before me
I try hard to stay calm
Even if I really asked you not to go
Even if I bravely say it out
Right now my vulnerable heart
Your stiff expressions
The beauty of lovereally did slowly wither
Every night I still dream of you
And see my naive self
And remember how we believed then
That the moon will always lead
The path to happiness
The moon also heard you say
Say that you will always love me
The bright red rose in my dreams
Is a pale white rose when I open my eyes
It lies under the moon
Commemorating what was once the truest love
No matter how sincere happiness was in memories
It freezes in the cold air
And right now under the moon
There's only a solitary grave
Guarding the love that died
This, love that died
At that time, the roses in your hands
And the line you lightly whispered in my ear
'I love you, I love you'
Can you at least not forget it
The bright red rose in my dreams
Is a pale white rose when I open my eyes
It lies under the moon
Commemorating what was once the truest love
No matter how sincere happiness was in memories
It freezes in the cold air
And right now under the moon

Embracing our beliefs. [Chorus]:
The white clouds and the azure sky
Will appear only after the storm.

By our ears our hearts beat as one.
Under the white clouds and the azure sky,
Our dreams will finally be fulfilled.
Beneath one common horizon
We'll venture freely, shoulder to shoulder, onward. I still remember
How bright the day was when we set off.
With the departing spring the autumn brings falling leaves,
The searing summer and the frigid winter will pass us by.
With the boundless joy of our pact. The newborn's heart is filled with hope
For the future, the past, for the splendor of life. We'll help each other up, cheering each other on
With our heartfelt blessings.
Just lift your head to the sky, take a deep breath,
And you'll feel the warmth. [Chorus]:

Will appear only after the storm.

My youth seemed to start from my loving you,
but I ended up disillusioned with love.
Ever since you lost your memory,
my fate started to turn around. It's just because your memory loss was so much worsened
that you, having forgotten me, found someone new,
a sneaky slut who never allows me to approach you. You have no memory for the rest of your life because you have forgotten your ex-lover
but you remember your destiny of loving another.
You who have no memory, just cheat
because you won't cross the line by just giving me a hug. chorus1
Kiss me, regardless of anything else.
This goodbye kiss will be like emptying a water bucket.
Maybe we'll see each other again only in heaven. To return to me you won't allow yourself.
But if we were never meant to be,
why are there tears in your eyes if I'm not mistaken? verse2
We are recollecting the past to each other as if not afraid that this relationship will come to an end.
But maybe I did too much evil in my previous life
so that I'm still willing to start anew with you and kneel down in church saying ""I do"". People are still coming and going at this fun house,
while I'm counting down for the sweet words we're exchanging.
The stupid man-made satellite can't detect that we
no longer recognize each other although we're meeting again. chorus2
Kiss me, regardless of anything else.
This goodbye kiss will be like emptying a water bucket.
Maybe we'll see each other again only in heaven. I'm coming down and you're going out.
We couldn't even bring ourselves to saying goodbye.
I will remember to meet you in heaven. Kiss me, regardless of anything else.
Once we were so meant to be.
Why are there tears in your eyes if I'm not mistaken? Remember to shed tears again on this day every year. ",lakoje,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lakoje

Sleepy flowers rest calmly under the moon.
Only the naughty clover.
Spreading her fragrance among the midnight air.
I enjoy the misery of the night.
I adore the songs of the nightingales.
Most of all, I love those dreams filled with flowers.
Kissing the night clover with a gentle touch.

当你盯着这优质神明
我只能说一句 不客气
把潮汐晴天送你
这很简单 很容易 不客气

当你蹒跚前行有我扶持
在寒冷夜里取暖的火都被偷走
有我在这里哟
噢 是我让太阳升起 不客气
让你多点开心日子

让船航行 树叶落地
这不过是小意思 不客气

我 其实 我可以一口气地
把所以大自然的现象都解释

都是我毛伊做的好事
我把海鳗狠狠地除掉
种一棵树让你得到椰子
明不明白 有没有新启示
就是当毛伊生气你快点回避
你看我皮肤的印记
都是彰显胜利的标志
我到哪里 哪里就出现好事
过去小气的小毛伊已变好脾气 还是这句告诉你 不客气
我把这世界变美丽

给你机会说声 不客气
我要借用你的船
要扬帆而去远地 不客气

Faced with this great life it is very wonderful
No one knows how to react
This is very adorable I realise that humans never change
Now broaden your horizons
See clearly, I am Maui, please calm down
I have a perfect hairstyle and stature
When you're staring at this great god
I can only say one thing, you're welcome
I gave you the tides and sunny days
This is very simple, very easy, you're welcome
I'm just a regular tough guy Hey, I hold up the sky with my fingers
When you stagger forward I support you
When in the freezing night fire keeping you warm is completely stolen
I am here, yo!
Oh, I make the sun rise, you're welcome
So you have many happy days
I can control the fierce winds, you're welcome
To make boats sail, to make leaves fall
This is a mere trifle, you're welcome
I brought the earth from the sea
You don't need to bow on ceremony, you're welcome
Ha, I'm just being myself You're welcome, you're welcome
Oh, to turn around and think about it
Actually, I could in one go
Explain all of Mother Nature's phenomena
The tides, grass, the ground
All good things done by me, Maui!
I harshly got rid of the eel
From the seed of a tree a coconut sprouted for you
Don't you understand, do you have a new inspiration?
When Maui is angry you must hurry to get away
Look at the marks in my skin
They all demonstrate the signs of victory
Where I have been, a good thing has arrived
Little Maui, miserly in the past, has already changed his good temper Still I'm telling you, you're welcome
I made this world beautiful
This is very simple, very easy, you're welcome
I remember now I have to go
It's your chance to say ""you're welcome""
I ask to borrow your boat
To sail far away, you're welcome
I'm best at everything except floating
You're welcome, you're welcome

没人发现它存在
多自由自在
可世界都爱热热闹闹
容不下我百无聊赖
不应该一个人发呆 只有我守着安静的沙漠
等待着花开
只有我看着别人的快乐
竟然会感慨
就让我听着天大的道理
不愿意明白
有什么是应该不应该 我的心里住着一个苍老的小孩
如果世界听不明白
对影子表白
是不是只有我还在问
为什么明天更精彩
烟火里找不到童真的残骸 只有我守着安静的沙漠
等待着花开
只有我看着别人的快乐
竟然会感慨
就让我听着天大的道理
不愿意明白
只有我
就是我
好奇怪 还在感慨
风阵阵吹过来
为何不回来
风一去不回来 悲不悲哀
麻木得那么快
应不应该
能不能慢下来 笑得开怀
哭得坦率
为何表情要让这世界安排
我就是我
我只是我
只是一场烟火散落的尘埃 风阵阵吹过来
风一去不回来 能不能慢下来 ","Watching the dancing ashes fall down
No one notices how free and unbounded their existence is
But the whole world loves the bustle
and cannot stand my listlessness
I shouldn't be alone, falling in a trance Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom
Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
What is there that should be or shouldn't be? In my heart, there lives an elderly child
If the world cannot comprehend me, then I would confess to the shadow
Am I the only one still asking
Why tomorrow will be more dazzling?
In the fireworks, no remnants of innocence can be found Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom
Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise
Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
There's only me
Who is just me
How strange I am still sighing
Gusts of wind are blowing past
Why doesn't it come back?
The wind leaves and never returns Isn't it sad?
We become numb so fast
Should or shouldn't it be?
Can it slow down? Laugh whole heartily
Cry frankly
Why should my expressions be arranged by this world?
I am just me
I am only me
Just the falling ashes from an outburst of fireworks Gusts of wind are blowing past
The wind leaves and never returns
Can it slow down? ",Hua Fansubs Hua,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/hua-fansubs-hua

We've loved for many years, why would it be worth it to destroy a classic?
We're both adults, we owe each other nothing
Wasting time is what I've been willing to do
Like an actor responding to a curtain's call
Helplessly watching the lights go out
There's not enough time left for an epic love story
Let's just maintain dignity at our goodbye
I don't regret loving you
I also respect that the story should be dignified Breakups should be dignified
Let none of us say sorry
There is no owing each other
If I dare to give, then I dare to be heart-broken
In front of the camera lens is us of olden times
Cheering
Crying and screaming til our voices are gone Leaving is very dignified too
We didn't let these years down
The view of us having loved earnestly
Diligently giving
Don't let obsession
ruin yesterday
I've loved you
My goodbye is not death by a thousand cuts On the most familiar street, but the show stars a different actor
I cry to the point of slightly choking; no matter how much my heart hurts, I'll just think of it as a silk worm breaking out of its cocoon

my voice reveals my melancholy. The music drifts faintly into the core of my heart
Pulling me towards finding what I seek along the way
Then a chance encounter, you with those clear sparkling eyes
Shakes me as though I were in a dream In that instant it seemed as though
I were living in a beautiful meaningful fairytale from long ago

就再去畫多點，應該還有空間

And add a few more details in my own gallery
Play guitar and knitting
And make something tasty
But when will my life begin Just after that, I'll play some puzzle and I'm going to make cookies
Make a mask and dance ballet and play chest
Make some potteries, train my accent and dry those candles
Stretch myself, add some more details
Climb up, then sew a dress
Then I'll go learn some more, if I have time to spare
I'll go draw some more, there should be still some space
And I'll have to deal with my hair without stopping
It feels like living here a day just like living here for a year
I can't stop thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking
But when will my life begin Tomorrow night, shining lights will appear
Just like every year, at my birthday
What does that day's sky looks like

You're free to find new love and leave no trace
But don't use paying me back as an excuse to hurt me again My eyes are reddened by tears
How much time do I need to forget that past love
My fragile heart still has the hurts you left
You lied that you'd make it up and used paying me back as an excuse, but how can I ever believe Love is a journey of the heart, I once promised to let you lead the way
The only problem is that I gave too much love, I won't complain that you're heartless
I have once listened to your confession patiently
And I have heard of your own trouble
Please don't use paying me back as an excuse to hurt my pride ** ",lakoje,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lakoje

消散在彼此眼前
就连说过了再见
也看不见你有些哀怨 给我的一切
你不过是在敷衍
你笑得越无邪
我就会爱你爱得更狂野 总在刹那间有一些了解
说过的话不可能会实现
就在一转眼发现你的脸
已经陌生不会再像从前 我的世界开始下雪
冷得让我无法多爱一天
冷得连隐藏的遗憾都那么地明显 我和你吻别在无人的街
让风痴笑我不能拒绝
我和你吻别在狂乱的夜
我的心等着迎接伤悲 想要给你的思念
就像风筝断了线
飞不进你的世界
也温暖不了你的视线 我已经看见
一出悲剧正上演
剧终没有喜悦
我仍然躲在你的梦里面 总在刹那间有一些了解
说过的话不可能会实现
就在一转眼发现你的脸
已经陌生不会再像从前 我的世界开始下雪
冷得让我无法多爱一天
冷得连隐藏的遗憾都那么地明显 我和你吻别在无人的街

Scattering in our eyes
Even though we`ve said goodbye
I can`t see your sadness at all Everything you`ve given me
is nothing but perfunctory
The more you laugh innocently
The more I love you widely Instantaneously I understand more or less
What you`ve said will never come true
All of sudden I find your face
has become so unfamiliar and it will never look like before The snow has started falling in my heart
It is so cold that I can`t love one day more
It is so cold that even the hidden sorrows are becoming so apparant You and I kiss goodbye on an empty street
Even the wind blows me up,I cannot resist it
You and I kiss goodbye on a crazy night
My heart is waiting for sadness come along How much I miss you
Is like a kite with broken string
Neither is can fly into your world
Nor improve your line of sight I can already see
a tragedy is being played
There is no happiness in the end
And I`m still hiding in your dreams Instantaneously I understand more or less
What you`ve said will never come true
All of sudden I find your face
has become so unfamiliar and it will never look like before The snow has started falling in my heart
It is so cold that I can`t love one day more
It is so cold that even the hidden sorrows are becoming so apparant You and I kiss goodbye on an empty street
Even the wind blows me up,I cannot resist it
You and I kiss goodbye on a crazy night

I still ran though,for 90 minutes
This plot is so heavy,
however I saw it and I was about to laugh
My home is on the next crossing,
what's going on with me?I got lost anyway
Christmas passed ,it was so long,
I'm still celebrating though, happy Valentine's Day
Reasonably speaking,that time,
I had no one but I  lived
After you left,why
was I changed into someone else,who's nothing like me? Just when I listen to the song,I'm furious,
this is not me,certainly it's not me
When I think about you,my heart is in pain,
this is not me,I'm not that weak
Love should ripe,
peaceful separation should be its harvest
What am I doing by holding onto memories?
this way I won't be losing anyone...
This is not me...
this is not me The sky is the end of the wide sea,
if I could finally walk onto this slope
Kiss me like a friend,
even though I'm not me Just when I listen to the song,I'm furious,
this is not me,certainly it's not me
When I think about you,my heart is in pain,
this is not me,I'm not that weak

this is not me,certainly it's not me
When I think about you ,it makes me crazy,
this is not me,I'm not that weak

but the taught wisdom didn't have any effect
The lost freedom can't be broken,

To go to a place far from home, covered with thistles and thorns. When the earth is covered with leaves felled in sorrow,
When azaleas become faraway fog,
Wish me well, the loved one I miss the most,
That's the view of my back when I tell you goodbye. Maybe the melancholy that has lost its way will tear my footsteps,
But I believe that the future will give me a pair of wings from dreams.
Even though the frustrating pain has already bruised me black and blue,
I firmly believe the light is in the distance. Maybe the perplexed journey will tear at my arms,
But I believe that the future will give me a pair of wings from dreams.
Even though the wounds from setbacks have already made me stuck,
I firmly believe the light is in the distance. I use my wings to rise up towards the waves at the horizon,
I use my body to drag [myself] up to the blood-red sun.
In the piercing and bitterly cold gales,
You will hear my shout praising the future. Maybe the melancholy that has lost its way will tear my footsteps,

The handwriting drifting to and fro

you see my wings
you say that it is only after fire that the phoenix appears

is a direction better for flying

I only fear that I would surrender Me and my final stubbornness

I like bringing gorgeous memories from travelling to you at home. Because we are one family,being deeply attached to each other.
We gather because of fate and cherish each other because of love,why to let dark clouds cover our eyes. Because we are one family,being deeply attached to each other.
We should share good fortune and come over difficult times together,exchange for foreverness with kindness and support. I am fond of forgetting the massive mood as soon as reaching home.
I am fond of showing smiling face to everybody as soon as getting up.
I am fond of fighting for individual and the world's beauty as soon as going out.
I am fond of one family dreaming at the same direction. Oh~ When others are happy,It's just like I've got happiness too.
When others are hurt,I would like to open my arms to them.
When others are angry,I would tell him not to be like that even if people's idea is different.
When I am needed by others,I would roll up my sleeves to help them. Because we are one family,being deeply attached to each other.
We gather because of fate and cherish each other bacause of love.
Why to let dark clouds cover our eyes. Because we are a family,We are a loving family.
Sharing joys and sorrows,we can intimately stay together forever and ever. ※Caring about each other to keep an ever-lasting tacit understanding.
Please believe that the feelings between us worth being grateful for.※ Because we are one family,being deeply attached to each other.
We gather because of fate and cherish each other bacause of love.
Why to let dark clouds cover our eyes. Because we are a family,We are a loving family.
Sharing joys and sorrows,we can intimately stay together forever and ever. ",wuhuahua089,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/wuhuahua089

故事等墨乾 卻等來心傷
從此緣分 模糊了紙上
少了三百年前的那幾張 看筆鋒幾道彎 前世千百轉
塵緣繫雲端 九重天上纏
無奈過往 三生石上斷
人間紛亂 無怨夜闌珊
恨夢太短 十里斷 桃花傷 愛飄落在何方
我只為你綻放 世間最美的模樣
十里斷 桃花傷 為你佛前拈香
求三生三世都 與你成雙 看筆鋒幾道彎 前世千百轉
塵緣繫雲端 九重天上纏
無奈過往 三生石上斷
人間紛亂 無怨夜闌珊
恨夢太短 十里斷 桃花傷 愛飄落在何方
我只為你綻放 世間最美的模樣
十里斷 桃花傷 為你佛前拈香
求三生三世都 與你成雙
十里不斷愛隨桃花 飄香 ","One stroke one soft sigh,one line one sadness.
The story is waiting for the ink to dry,yet the wait brought in heartache.
Since then, fate was blurred out on paper.
These sheets of paper less three hundred years ago. Looking at how sharp and how many curves the brushstroke,many rounds of incarnation in previous lives.
The fate in the mortal world tangled through the clouds, intertwined through the ninth Heaven.
Hopelessly passing through, three lives were broken upon the rocks.
The chaos among men,no complaints through the late of nights.
Hated that the dream is too short. Broken upon ten miles,the pain of the peach blossoms,where did love drift and settle?
I will blossom for you,the world’s most beautiful presence.
Broken upon ten miles,the pain of the peach blossoms,lighting incense in front of the Gods for you.
Wishing to be a pair with you through three lifetimes. Looking at how sharp and how many curves the brushstroke,many rounds of incarnation in previous lives.

秃鹫一样 栖息在山顶上
阿刁 大昭寺门前铺满阳光
打一壶甜茶 我们聊着过往 阿刁 你总把自己打扮的像
男孩子一样 可比格桑还顽强
阿刁 狡猾的人有千百种笑
你何时下山 记得带上卓玛刀 灰色帽檐下 凹陷的脸颊
你很少说话 简单的回答
明天在哪里 谁会在意你
即使死在路上 阿刁 明天是否能吃顿饱饭
你已习惯 饥饿是一种信仰
阿刁 不会被现实磨平棱角
你不是这世界的人 没必要在乎真相 命运多舛 痴迷 淡然
挥别了青春 数不尽的车站
甘于平凡却不甘平凡的腐烂
你是阿刁 你是自由的鸟 灰色帽檐下 凹陷的脸颊
你很少说话 简单的回答
明天在哪里 谁会在意你
即使死在路上 命运多舛 痴迷 淡然
挥别了青春 数不尽的车站
甘于平凡却不甘平凡的腐烂
你是阿刁 ","A'Diao, she lives in some part of Tibet;
She's like a vulture, perching on Mountain tops.
A'Diao, there's a flood of sunlight before the gates of *Jokhang Temple;
We make a pot of sweet tea and talk about our pasts. A'Diao, you always dress yourself up
Like a boy, you're more tenacious than *Ge'sang flowers.
A'Diao, the cunning have a thousand different ways of smiling.
When are you descending the mountain? Remember to bring a *Zhuo'ma knife. Under the grey brim of your hat, hollow cheeks;
You speak rarely, you reply simply.
Where will you be tomorrow? Who will even care
if you die on the road? A'Diao, will you be able to feed yourself one full meal tomorrow?
You've gotten used to hunger as some sort of faith.
A'Diao, you don't let reality smooth your edges;
You're not a person of this world, there's no need bother about the Truth. Destiny's contradiction-filled; obsession and indifference.
Waved goodbye to the countless train stations of Youth,
Content with the ordinary but discontent with mediocrity.
You are A'Diao—you are the bird of Freedom. Under the grey brim of your hat, hollow cheeks;
You speak rarely, you reply simply.
Where will you be tomorrow? Who will even care
if you die on the road? Destiny's contradiction-filled; obsession and indifference.
Waved goodbye to the countless train stations of Youth,
Content with the ordinary but discontent with mediocrity.
You are A'Diao. ",ahss010,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/ahss010
