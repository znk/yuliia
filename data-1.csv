高耸古老的城墙 挡不住忧伤
我飘向北方 家人是否无恙
肩上沉重的行囊 盛满了惆怅 有人说他在老家欠了一堆钱 需要避避风头
有人说他练就了一身武艺却没机会崭露
有人失去了自我 手足无措四处漂流
有人为了梦想为了三餐为养家餬口 他住在燕郊区 残破的求职公寓
拥挤的大楼里 堆满陌生人都来自外地
他埋头写着履历 怀抱着多少憧憬
往返在九三零号公路 内心盼著奇蹟 忍着泪 (不听也不想 不敢回头望的遗憾)
掩著伤 (扛下了梦想 要毅然决然去流浪)
抬头看 (卸下了自尊 光环 过去多风光)
著斜阳 (就算再不堪 败仗 也不能投降) 亲爱的 (再见了南方 眺望最美丽的家乡)
在远方 (椰子树摇晃 梦境倒映着的幻象)
这城市 (雾霾太猖狂 不散 都看不清前方)
太迷惘 我漂向北方 别问我家乡
高耸古老的城墙 挡不住忧伤
我漂向北方 家人是否无恙
肩上沉重的行囊 盛满了惆怅
也是最后寄望 回不去的远方 Oh 空气太脏 太混浊 他说不喜欢
车太混乱 太匆忙 他还不习惯
人行道一双又一双 斜视冷漠的眼光
他经常将自己灌醉 强迫融入 这大染缸 走着脚步蹒跚 二锅头在摇晃
失意的人啊偶尔醉倒在那胡同陋巷
咀嚼爆肚涮羊 手中盛着一碗热汤
用力地 温暖著 内心里的不安 忍着泪 (不听也不想 不敢回头望的遗憾)
掩著伤 (扛下了梦想 要毅然决然去流浪)
抬头看 (卸下了自尊 光环 过去多风光)
著斜阳 (就算再不堪 败仗 也不能投降) 亲爱的 (再见了南方 眺望最美丽的家乡)
在远方 (椰子树摇晃 梦境倒映着的幻象)
这城市 (雾霾太猖狂 不散 都看不清前方)
太迷惘 我漂向北方 别问我家乡
高耸古老的城墙 挡不住忧伤
我漂向北方 家人是否无恙
肩上沉重的行囊 盛满了惆怅 就像那尘土飘散随着风向 谁又能带领着我一起飞翔
我站在天坛中央闭上眼 祈求一家人都平安 我漂向北方 别问我家乡
高耸古老的城墙 挡不住忧伤
我漂向北方 家人是否无恙
肩上沉重的行囊 盛满了惆怅 (我漂向北方)我站在天子脚下 被踩得喘不过气
(别问我家乡)走在前门大街 跟人潮 总会分歧
(高耸古老的城墙)或许我根本不属于这里 早就该离去
(挡不住忧伤)谁能给我致命的一击 请用力到彻底 (我漂向北方)这里是梦想的中心 但梦想都遥不可及
(家人是否无恙)这里是圆梦的圣地 但却总是扑朔迷离
(肩上沉重的行囊)多少人敌不过残酷的现实 从此销声匿迹
(盛满了惆怅)多少人陷入了昏迷 剩下一具 空壳尸体
(也是最后寄望) Rest In Peace
回不去的远方 Oh
漂向北方 别再问我家乡 ","Stranger in the north / Don't ask about my hometown
Even these towering old walls / Can't block the sadness
I'm a stranger in the north / How is my family doing?
Carrying on my shoulders a bag / Full of gloom Some said he'd gotten into trouble back home / And had to escape
Some say he'd trained for years / And came to show his skills
Some men have lost themselves / Helpless, lost, wandering
Some men work hard to fill their stomach and support their families Living near the outskirts of Beijing  / Desperately searching for a job and apartment
Crowded buildings / Filled with so many foreign faces
He hurriedly wrote a resume / With longing in his heart
Pacing back and forth 930th Avenue / Hoping for a miracle Hold in the tears (Don't listen and don't think / Don't look back and don't regret)
Hide the pain (Pursuing a dream / Searching with determination)
Raise your head (Let go of your pride / And past achievements)
See the setting sun (Even if it's unbearable / Defeat but never surrender) Loved ones (Farewell to the south / The most beautiful homeland)
Are far away (The swaying coconut trees / Dreamland reflecting his fantasies)
This city (The lingering haze is too thick / Can't see what's ahead)
Is too bewildering I'm a stranger in the north / Don't ask about my hometown
Even these towering old walls / Can't block the sadness
I'm a stranger in the north / How is my family doing?
Carrying on my shoulders a bag / Full of gloom
It's my last hope / Can't go back home Oh The air is filthy / Too turbid / He can't stand it
The traffic is chaotic / Too hasty / He's not used to it
The people on the sidewalk / With cold and cynical eyes
He took refuge in drink / Attempting to fit in to this society Staggering around / Erguotou liquor swaying in hand
Frustrated souls sometimes drunkenly collapse in that alleyway
Chewing a piece of lamb / Bowl of warm soup in hand
Desperately trying to dispel the angst inside Hold in the tears (Don't listen and don't think / Don't look back and don't regret)
Hide the pain (Pursuing a dream / Searching with determination)
Raise your head (Let go of your pride / And past achievements)
See the setting sun (Even if it's unbearable / Defeat but never surrender) Loved ones (Farewell to the south / The most beautiful homeland)
Are far away (The swaying coconut trees / Dreamland reflecting his fantasies)
This city (The lingering haze is too thick / Can't see what's ahead)
Is too bewildering (Farewell to the south / The most beautiful homeland) I'm a stranger in the north / Don't ask about my hometown
Even these towering old walls / Can't block the sadness
I'm a stranger in the north / How is my family doing?
Carrying on my shoulders a bag / Full of gloom Just like sand floating in the wind / Who can help me soar
I stand at the Temple of Heaven and pray that all is well at home I'm a stranger in the north / Don't ask about my hometown
Even these towering old walls / Can't block the sadness
I'm a stranger in the north / How is my family doing?
Carrying on my shoulders a bag / Full of gloom
It's my last hope / Can't go back home Oh (I'm a stranger in the north) It's like I'm standing at the emperor's feet / Suffocated and can't breathe
(Don't ask about my hometown) Even on the street outside my door / My differences result in arguments
(Even these towering old walls) Maybe I will never belong here / Should have left long ago
(Can't block the sadness) Can someone please just kill me now / And make it clean (I'm a stranger in the north) This is the land of dreams / But my dream is still out of reach
(How is my family doing?) This is the holy land of dreams / But so disorienting
(Carrying on my shoulders a bag) How many men fall to the harshness of reality / And disappear forever
(Full of gloom) How many men fall into a coma / Leaving only an empty shell behind
(It's my last hope) Rest In Peace
Can't go back home Oh
Stranger in the north / Don't ask about my hometown ",jhan,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/jhan

也算懂得 什麼適合 什麼不可
最近還是一樣 努力著 配合你的性格
你的追求者 你的坎坷 我開的車 算一算 虛度了多少個年頭
彷彿足夠 寫一套錯愛的春秋
如果以後 你還想為誰 浪費美好時候
眼淚只能在我的胸膛 毫無保留 互相折磨到白頭
悲傷堅決不放手
開始糾纏之後
才又被人放大了自由
你的暴烈太溫柔
感情又痛又享受
如果我說 不吻你不罷休
誰能逼我將就 你問我 為什麼頑固而專一
天下太大 總有人比你更合適
其實我覺得這樣不值 可沒選擇方式
你一出場 別人都顯得不過如此 互相折磨到白頭

才又被人放大了自由

I also considered I understood what was suitable and what wasn’t
Recently, still hardworking as usual to accord with your character
Your suitors, your frustrations ,the car I drive Calculate how many wasted years
Seems like it is enough to write a spring and autumn period 1 of misplaced favors
If you are willing to waste good time for someone
There can only be tears on my chest There will be no reservation Torturing each other until our hairs are white
Determined to not let go of sadness
After beginning to become entangled
Only to have our freedom be taken by others again
Your violence is too gentle
Emotions are painful and enjoyable
If I say I cannot give up without kissing you
Who can force my will You ask me why I’m stubborn and single-minded
The world is so big, there has to be someone more suitable than you
Actually I feel that it is not worth it this way,there is no way to choose
When you appear other people all appear unimpressed Torturing each other until our hairs are white
Determined to not let go of sadness
After beginning to become entangled
Only to have our freedom be taken by others again
Your violence is too gentle
Emotions are painful and enjoyable
If I say I cannot give up without kissing you
Who can force my will Torturing each other until our hairs are white
Determined to not let go of sadness

Rather, it's just that you aren't smart enough
So near yet maintaining a distance from you
Then there will not be a need to worry about losing you Protecting you from you back is gentler than holding your hand
Only allowing your shadows to lie in my chest
Hiding my love behind my back accompanies my invisible gentleness
Like how a bosom friend does not bother your heart
Sorrow also seems painless, Tears are also accompanied with a smile
An impulse without a beginning also doesn't have an ending Rather than avoiding your eye contact
It has stirred a sense of possibility in me
Taking the opportunity before you see through me, I turn around
(You) thought that I was mysterious
Rather, it's just that you aren't smart enough

so this is what
we all called love I've to admit that you've a alluring smile
It's unforgettable
saying what ""I'm forever yours""

enjoy the sunset view with you

- enjoy the seasons and the views
- writing the rest of my life chapter
with you as the main character - sharing the laughter and tears

we will never break up I accidentally came across
you singing our songs
thanks to the glimpse of chance
now I get to embrace you in my arms The world is in high spirits
so we join in too

the full bloomed flowers in June It's so crowded on the long bridge

Just like me, the one being deceived, is well-being.
Who should I blame?
You tell lies since you still love me. Beautiful bubbles just like sudden fireworks,
Although your promises seem too fragile,
love just like bubbles.
If I can see it through, why should I upset? I should have known bubbles are fragile.
Just like my injured heart, cannot stand torture anymore.
It is not anyone's fault.
Even the lies become frequent, since you still love me. Beautiful bubbles just like sudden fireworks,
Although your promises seem too fragile,
love just like bubbles.
If I can see it through, why should I upset? Even prettier flowers, they will die after blossoming.
Even brighter stars, they will collapse after shining.
Love is bubbles in fact.
If I can see it through, why should I upset?  Why should I upset? Why should I upset? Everything is bubbles just like sudden fireworks,
Your promises are too fragile.
I should be blamed not to see your true colours through.
So, I am upset. How can I search our love evidence?
Is it possible that I am not lonely when embracing loneliness?
Love is bubbles in fact and I should be blamed not to see it through.
So, I am upset. Bubbles under raindrops is fragile.
My passionate heart has sunk already.
Don't tell me that you love me. If you intend to cheat me,
I would prefer you to keep silent. ",secantt,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/secantt

怎么去拥抱 一夏天的风

总是不能懂 不能觉得足够 如果我爱上 你的笑容
要怎么收藏 要怎么拥有
如果你快乐 不是为我
会不会放手 其实才是拥有 当一阵风吹来 风筝飞上天空
为了你而祈祷 而祝福 而感动
终于你身影消失在 人海尽头
才发现 笑着哭 最痛 那天你和我 那个山丘
那样的唱着 那一年的歌
那样的回忆 那么足够
足够我天天 都品尝着寂寞 当一阵风吹来 风筝飞上天空
为了你而祈祷 而祝福 而感动
终于你身影消失在 人海尽头
才发现 笑着哭 最痛 当一阵风吹来 风筝飞上天空

How do you go about embracing a summer breeze?
The stars high in the sky are laughing at the people below.
""They never do understand, they never find contentment."" If I were to fall in love with your smile,
how would I keep it, how would I obtain it?
And if you were happy but not because of me,
Whether or not I let go, would be how I do. When a gust of wind this way blows, kites fly high in the sky,
and for you I pray, I bless and I am moved.
And when your silhouette finally disappears into the sea of people,
I realise, it's most painful smiling through your tears.  You and me, that day and on that hill
That way we sang, that song from that year
That kind of memory, that was plenty and enough—
Enough for me to feel loneliness day after day. When a gust of wind this way blows, kites fly high in the sky,
and for you I pray, I bless and I am moved.
And when your silhouette finally disappears into the sea of people,
I realise, it's most painful smiling through your tears.  When a gust of wind this way blows, kites fly high in the sky,

how would I keep it, how would I obtain it?
And if you were happy but not because of me,
Whether or not I let go, would be how I do. The happiness from contentment,
it beckons me to endure the heartache.

only became regrets.
Memories were wrecked,
I suffer alone in despair.
How do I reclaim,

During the day, there's a lot of traffic, but now, beneath my feet is the River of Forgetting
I walk alone in the mountain, with wild dogs as my companion
The woods look as if painted, big ships move forward, wind passes through the gate of demons 5 years and some have passed as if in a moment, I eat plainly
In 6 worlds, 8 lands, and 4 oceans, no one challenges me
the world is absurd, outside the bamboo woods, there's a reading room
Being hidden here is great, but those who visit harbor malice, and nice people don't visit Is it that I'm pretending and talking bullshit
or is it that they have ill will and scheme
Some people don't repent, mixing right and wrong in the mist
Being unethical in positive emotions, others don't dare to be whistle blowers it appears that there is good luck, but what's happening is crime while there's heavy scrutiny
When the ending comes, who's still watching?
Practicing in this carnal world for 20 years, hearing that water can bore through rocks
Emperors' heroic effects on the world do not compare with the power of time I don't care who sits on the throne, I only have attachment to puppy love
I don't care for rocking the boat, I alone guard Mount E Mei
5 years and some have passed as if in a moment, I eat plainly
In 6 worlds, 8 lands, and 4 oceans, no one challenges me the world is absurd, outside the bamboo woods, there's a reading room

Being hidden here is great, but those who visit harbor malice, and nice people don't visit

Being unethical in positive emotions, others don't dare to be whistle blowers
it appears that there is good luck, but what's happening is crime while there's heavy scrutiny
When the ending comes, who's still watching? Silence coupled with chatter
Just browsing, let me join in the crowds
Even if just making a cameo, don't be too careless
Gotta dip my oyster in sauce Silence and your chatter
Just browsing the crowds that you join
Hearing you make a mark
Please put it in the bag, don't show it off Some people realize they're in the wrong and they turn back
That's how they end their misery and expect a brighter future
5 years and some have passed as if in a moment

Next to the green wall, you look at the sunset
With just a casual look
You mess up my thoughts and make me stay up late I want to turn into Zhuang Zhou and become a butterfly1
And glide across the green clouds and tree leaves
Even if the mountains are stacked2
I don't want to stop here I will send my lovesickness to the bright moon
Hoping that you will notice
I will write you as a poem
And send it innocently across a thousand miles You are the dream that soaks the new moon white
That brings an overcast of sadness and joy
You are the breeze that dyes maple leaves red
That carries my thoughts through the mountains You are the tears that soak through the first snow
That's why you can come and go as you like
You are the you who dyed my years red
Changed my silent black and white world Like the stream that trickles through the old street
And takes away the dreamlike season
The people on the bridge pass by endlessly
Dragging my troubled thoughts If we can't recognize the butterflies Liang Zhu3 turned into
And ride on purple mist through the heavenly palace
We won't understand the feeling of parting
The autumn wind blowing off the leaves I will send my lovesickness to the bright moon
My heart is in turmoil, I can't decide
I prepare for a long night
Like the numerous stars flickering on the sky You are the dream that soaks the new moon white
That brings an overcast of sadness and joy
You are the breeze that dyes maple leaves red
That carries my thoughts through the mountains You are the tears that soak through the first snow
That's why you can come and go as you like
You are the you who dyed my years red
Changed my silent black and white world You are the dream that soaks the new moon white
That brings an overcast of sadness and joy
You are the breeze that dyes maple leaves red
That carries my thoughts through the mountains You are the tears that soak through the first snow
That's why you can come and go as you like
You are the you who dyed my years red

Smile in the face of this cold-eyed observation
Heaven and Earth are illusions

A kind of walk leads to that kind of mountain
No one dares to bet through the ending
Choke out a laugh when the curtain falls
Repeated shows
No wonder the fleeting sensations of freshness are illusions No matter how you paint and shade the words
Light and dark are illusions
Forgive those who watch for entertainment
Coming and going are illusions
How clamorous is the opening stage
Rising and falling are illusions
How bleak is the ending
Heaven and Earth are illusions
Talking about heroism
There are only stories
Never anything about ever after In a few moments of indulging
Remembering only what's talk-worthy
Watching from the sidelines never lasts
Only the lucky exemptions are called history
Why not walk out of the mountain / Smile as I look at all things as illusions Be drunk as I wish / Be as free as I wish

Let me listen to principles that are as enormous as the sky and be unwilling to comprehend.  There is only me, it is me—how strange—[who's] still sighing with emotion.
The wind blows towards [me], gust after gust. Why does [it] not return?
The wind passes and never returns. Isn't that such a sorrowful thing?
Oh how quickly [I am] numbed. Should or shouldn't [it be so]?
Can or can't [it] slow down? Laugh to [your] heart's content. Cry candidly.
Why should [you] allow this world to arrange [your] expressions?
I am me. I'm only me,
Only the dust that's scattered by a round of fireworks. The wind blows towards [me], gust after gust.
The wind passes and never returns.
Can or can't [it] slow down? ",wuhuahua089,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/wuhuahua089

Be it fireworks flaring and fading, refusing to give into despair
Warm your hands with your breath, take shelter in the date forest in your memories
The you, who I became addicted to relying upon, where are you now?  was it misunderstandings that cut, inch by inch, turning into wounds
was it stubbornness forcing, with each exhale and inhale, the pretense of indifference
I force myself to understand that fate is like willow catkins*
forced to separate and float towards their own directions, upon the blowing of the wind Wistfulness is the most miserable warmth, just like a pair of wings
That prevents me from resting and flying further, unable to move on from the past
The you, who left without a goodbye, even if you were only being considerate towards me
This kind of cherishing leaves a bitterness that I don't know how to rise above Cloaked in my most miserable warmth, it's a kind of wish
That happiness will blossom like sunlight by your side
In the vast seas of people, we collided turbulently once upon a time
 and that encounter will remain in both of our hearts, surging relentlessly like the ocean waves  Even when the flowers have withered, if you still have feelings then you will still be able to smell their fragrance
Even when the people have parted, if you still have the heart to, you can still hear the sounds of the gathering
A period of waiting filled with affection, no matter how endless it feels, the wait still won't be long Wistfulness is the most miserable warmth, just like a pair of wings
That prevents me from resting and flying further, unable to move on from the past
The you, who left without a goodbye, even if you were only being considerate towards me
This kind of cherishing leaves a bitterness that I don't know how to rise above Cloaked in my most miserable warmth, it's a kind of wish

I don't need unlimited power.
The sun illuminates my path during the day, and the glow of my eyes illuminates it at night.
Apart from the numbness of loneliness, that would make me lose miserably,
I haven't encountered anything else that would make me feel truly terrible. Even with the wind,
My gaze is determined and full of strength.
I told myself to be guided by instinct
When making history.
Crossing mountains and rocks,
I single-handedly shook heaven and earth.
Only lack of purpose and fearlessness
Can make me stronger.

I refuse to compromise with fate because there's a place where my heart has refuge.
It's you. I don't belong to anyone

To finally feel that the reason for separation is justified.
Is love for experience, or to be treasured?
Such that everyday is unforgettable. How many obstacles have we been through? How long were our eyes filled with tears?
To finally realize that sorrow is what's left after love dies.
How many couple-beds have we slept on? How many times have we changed our beliefs?
To finally exchange wedding rings without looking back at the past. Pass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.
Reflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.
Everyone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,
Rejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.
Wait for the sorrow to disappear and better days to come again.
The sunlight envelops, forgive all the letters that were written.
How much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? The candle brightens up the atmosphere but does not illuminate an answer. Love is not just a simple, heartwarming meal.
Scattering flower petals on the bed, embrace will nurture love.
Yet too much of love will cause it to bloom on another's soil. Love needs to be handled by not just one person, closing distances will create expectations, and expectations will bring disappointment - An endless vicious cycle.
Romance is short lived, time will cause dissatisfaction.
The end of youth brings about a loyal partner.
Pass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.
Reflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.
Everyone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,
Rejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.

How much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? Pass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.
Reflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.
Everyone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,
Rejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.
Wait for the sorrow to disappear and better days to come again.
The sunlight envelops, forgive all the letters that were written.
How much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? Don't be disappointed, the trials for one's soul is to obtain the bliss of simplicity.﻿ ",AlbertCai,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/albertcai

孙 悟 空)* ","( Destroy your mount Hua-Guo
Oh, you don’t give up.
They said it was a destiny) Sun and moon are recurring
Who's commanded Qi-Tian
To let go of gratitude and grudges?
Love and hate strung together
Couldn't escape from the fingertips Under the vast sky may I ask: What are life, death, or karma?
Wherefore was I born?
Why have you brought me forth yet will not answer my doubts?
You said: ""Become a Buddha at this instant""
If I became a Buddha would there be no devils in this world?
Who can tell me?
Look, the sandstorm blocked the Sun and enveloped the world in dust
Above Heaven's Palace
The moon was no different than that above Mount Hua-Guo
I won my first battle with glory and fame, yet you tried to catch me with inescapable nets You won without honor, I couldn't dodge hidden arrows So many daybreaks had slipped away unnoticed
The ending and truth remained elusive
as I trod forward
Fragrance of peach blossoms persisted in my dreams
Yet it couldn't resist your trickery
The truth of black and white is waiting for the daybreak
Can it directly write down your natural talent (of trickery)?
Daggers and blades out of sheath
Dragons and phoenixes collapsed as kylins fell
Flight of jade steps shattered at the swing of my golden cudgel (Qi-Tian's weapon) There was no chance for regret. Over thousand years and in this Universe, all that have left is my golden cudgel
Why had my victories ended in loneliness
Whose name was whispered by wind in my dreams
I said ""Excuse me"" but there's no way I'd admit defeat
Treading across the Southern Heaven, I swore upon mountains and rivers
Till the end of the world
Who was young and wild
Who can give me a belief
Spring had not ended, the moon was shining
I wanted to be there Unfortunately the wind blew early, I missed my chance
The dawn was breaking
The constricting headhand had not been forged
I could still smile Love, hate, worries and fear fogged my eyes
Thunders of thousands of soldiers shook the world
But they still could not confine me
Millions of heavenly warriors advanced and spread
Don't even think about my surrender
You cannot decide the victor of this battle
The Heaven's palace was turned upside down with one swing of my cudgel
To hell with fate I choose my own destiny
I want these mountains to move away from my inroads
I want these waters to part to make my returning path
I want heaven and earth to yield to me
The world shattered at the tip of my cudgel
You picked up a flower with a smile, the sky was filled with dusk clouds
I've cried, laughed, loved, hated, obsessed and went mad
What has left that I could not let go of?
I want these absurd rules to end in as a farce One day, under Heaven and Earth the stone heart (of Qi-Tian) was caught in a paradox
The so called Nothingness IS the exile at the portal to where we came from
Tide rises and falls
It occurred that ""Nothingness"" is the so called ""The Great Sage of Heaven's Equal"" (I have been here
I fought
I don't care about the ending.
I am Great Sage Equal to Heaven

全部都小心地收集
我总是偷偷地哭泣
像倦鸟失了归期
但愿我相信的爱情
结局紧握在我手心
时光匆匆却没有遗失过去 希望我们 有光明的未来
还有能够装下星空的期待
可现实为何让我感到如此懈怠
总怀念相遇时我们无视落叶和人海
是你让我勇敢不再像颗尘埃 是你常帮我照料装着梦的盆栽
每一天我们都是如此愉快
一直到天色渐晚看着落日无奈离开
我知道你爱集邮爱笑甚至爱发呆
我知道你怕草虫还有夜晚的妖怪
我喜欢你有一点心不在焉的状态
看起来像个回到七岁时候的小孩
该如何将我这份感情向你告白
喜欢却又不敢爱
直到整个宇宙
在为我焦虑失神慌张之中醒来
就像是黑暗过后黎明盛开 我们之间的回忆
全部都小心地收集
我总是偷偷地哭泣
像倦鸟失了归期
但愿我相信的爱情
结局紧握在我手心
时光匆匆却没有遗失过去 那天你在雨后街角答应接受我的爱
那一刻我的世界有了色彩
这一生无法忘记关于澄蓝色的你
像一份礼物悄然呈现在我的境遇
我们从清晨起玩一整天游戏
到夜晚一起看我最爱的剧
能够拥有这些已足够幸运
我已经不再期待其他什么东西
我们也经常争执互相不接电话
在同一房间终于呼叫冷漠抵达
也曾想过以后生活没有人牵挂
把爱扔掉只剩一块残酷伤疤
而那些你送我的梦，教我折的花
逃亡的盛夏
在夜空隐没之际为我点燃烟花
寂寞时让我把快乐拼起来吧 我们之间的回忆
全部都小心地收集
我总是偷偷地哭泣
像倦鸟失了归期
但愿我相信的爱情
结局紧握在我手心
时光匆匆却没有遗失过去 我们可以就像是孩子一样成长
永远无所畏惧义无反顾向着未知的前方
原来我们每天努力长成看似大人的模样
为了可以一起跨越山和海洋
那时的我每天都祈祷 实现这个梦想
现在的你还好吗
是否还会像从前一样的爱笑
现在的你还好吗
当你径直在我面前坦言放下
现在的你还好吗
是否像从前一样有无限的温柔啊
现在的你还好吗
愿你能保持月亮般的心，要爱自己啊 我们之间的回忆
全部都小心地收集
我总是偷偷地哭泣
像倦鸟失了归期
但愿我相信的爱情
结局紧握在我手心
时光匆匆却没有遗失过去 独自收集两个人之间的回忆
即使每当到这时候我都会哭泣
为何一切，变得如此，无法回到过去
但我仍愿意感谢你给过我爱情
每一场风景都是我们爱的证明
就算如今，天各一方，祝你余生动听啊 独自收集两个人之间的回忆
即使每当到这时候我都会哭泣
为何一切，变得如此，无法回到过去
但我仍愿意感谢你给过我爱情
每一场风景都是我们爱的证明
就算如今，天各一方，把回忆拼好给你 ","The memories between us
I have been carefully collecting
I often secretly cry
like a tired bird that's missed its due date to return
I wish that the love I believe in
I hold the ending tightly in my fist
Time flies but I haven't lost the past I wish that we have a bright future
And an expectation that can hold the entire starry night sky
But why does reality make me feel so fatigued
Reminiscing how when we first met, we ignored falling leaves and crowds
You made me brave, no longer like dust You often helped me take care of the bonsai of dreams
We were so happy day after day
Until it slowly got dark, looking at the setting sun, and we could do nothing but leave
I know you liked to collect stamps, liked to smile, and even to zone out
I know you're afraid of bugs in the grass and monsters in the night
I like when you get kind of distracted
As if you returned to the age of 7
How should I confess this affection to you
I like you, but I don't dare love you
Until this universe
woke up due to my anxiety
like the blooming dusk after the dark The memories between us
I have been carefully collecting
I often secretly cry
like a tired bird that's missed its due date to return
I wish that the love I believe in
I hold the ending tightly in my fist
Time flies but I haven't lost the past That day, after the rain, in the street corner, you accepted my love
From that moment on, my world had color
In this lifetime, I cannot forget you, who was clear blue
Like a gift, stealthily appearing in my world
From morning, we played games for the whole day
In the evening, we watched my favorite show together
Having these is lucky enough
I am not expectant of much else
We often fought and didn't pick up the phone
Until we were in the same room, and started to talk coldly to each other
I've thought of not having someone to care about later on
Throwing away love, leaving behind only a cruel scar
And the dreams you gifted to me, the origami flowers you taught me to fold
A summer of escaping
Lighting fireworks for me the moment before it turned pitch dark
When we're lonely, let me put happiness together The memories between us
I have been carefully collecting
I often secretly cry
like a tired bird that's missed its due date to return
I wish that the love I believe in
I hold the ending tightly in my fist
Time flies but I haven't lost the past We can grow like children
Always fearless, always facing the future, towards the unknown in front of us
I'm just realizing that we worked hard everyday, growing up to look like adults
is so that we can surmount mountains, oceans
Back then, I prayed everyday for realizing this dream
How are you these days?
Do you still love to smile like back then?
How are you these days?
In front of me, you said in a straight-forward way, that you wanted to let go of this relationship
How are you these days?
Do you still have boundless tenderness like before?
How are you these days?
I hope you can keep your heart moon-like, love yourself. The memories between us
I have been carefully collecting
I often secretly cry
like a tired bird that's missed its due date to return
I wish that the love I believe in
I hold the ending tightly in my fist
Time flies but I haven't lost the past Collecting the memories between us, alone
Every time this happens, I cry
Why has everything become like this, impossible to go back to the past?
But I'm still willing to be grateful for the love you've given me
Every scenery is evidence of our love
Even if, today, we are scattered, I hope the rest of your life sounds beautiful Collecting the memories between us, alone
Every time this happens, I cry
Why has everything become like this, impossible to go back to the past?
But I'm still willing to be grateful for the love you've given me
Every scenery is evidence of our love
Even if, today, we are scattered, I complete the jigsaw puzzle of our memories to give to you ",BendersB,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/bendersb

找回那片大自然
围著你 抱紧你 相信你

if you're tired, don't be a stranger

we'll share the burden (Vanness Wu)
the warmth of coffee refills
warm until you've let go [of what's bothering you]
let me fill the void in your mood

yesterday will be replaced by today and tomorrow
passion will never go out of fashion
caring will always be there (F4)
even if you and I lose each other in the crowd and the noise
friendship will rush over first thing
let the overanxious heart lie down flat
breathe easy all over again
deeply, fully
friend(s), if you are so depressed by loneliness that you can't call out
I will send out my caring first thing
my blazing eyes will help you see that it's ok

Edition: Orleusa_欧丽娟 I have been in a good mood lately and I don't know what's the reason
The feeling I have in my heart I wanna sing it to you
Watching the little stars from the window my heart thinks of my secret
Whether is love, I am not sure But I just know this,  I'm thinking of you
The distance between us suddenly seems so far and so close
Obviously, you are not with me but I still feel you so dearly
Ha ~ there is this feeling that I wanna express the secret in my heart is the sweetness you give me
The distance between us seems a little closer
Do you also have special feelings for me?
I hesitate telling you, the secret in my heart is like I am falling in love with you
At night the sound that befriends me is killing and also touching
This very tiring voice is the most gentle proof
You are, you are my secret
This vague relation has an untold beauty
Ha ~ I really wanna express it clearly
The secret in my heart is the sweetness you give me
The distance between you and me is drawing near day by day
Kind of a special feeling that some people will never understand
Ha ~ I wanna the whole world to know
The secret in my heart Is that I will deeply love you forever
Love you deeply ",Orleusa_欧丽娟,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/orleusa%E6%AC%A7%E4%B8%BD%E5%A8%9F

 媽媽給我生命 現在讓我自生自滅
 這讓我恐懼 在我的眼裡每個人都戴著面具
 回想過去 難道生命就是這樣延續
 我抽菸抽得我的肺都黑了
 就像整個社會被人心籠罩著它也是黑的
 我背著宿命的十字架
 也渴望Power,Paper and Respect
 我想這大概就是Human Nature
 佛家說 煩惱即是菩提 我暫且不提
 我倒是希望能夠回到母體
 老媽對不起 我時常把你氣得跺腳
 你說你後悔當初沒有墮胎把我墮掉
 每當我放學回家 放下那沉重的背包
 家裡空無一人 只殘留著你香水的味道
 那時我知道 你那天晚上又要加班
 我打開冰箱 拿出微波爐食品當晚餐
 老爸在凌晨兩點鐘 醉醺醺地回家
 我從睡夢中醒來 只聽到你們在吵架
 我沒有辦法專心面對第二天的考試
 老師他不喜歡我 我也不喜歡老師
 我討厭穿制服 我討厭學校的制度
 我討厭訓導主任的嘴臉 討厭被束縛
 That's True 很多人不屑我的態度
 他們說我太酷 警察不爽我都曾將我逮捕
 I Don't Give A Fuck About 人家說什麼
 他們想說什麼就說什麼 但是他們算什麼
 沒有誰有權利拿他的標準衡量我
 主宰是我自己 隨便人家如何想 我還是我
 愛錢的女人只給凱子摸
 不懂得用保險套的人別嫌孩子多
 金錢力量雖大 卻生不帶來死不帶走

有多少夜 痛苦煩惱著你無法入睡 *Life's a Struggle 日子還要過
品嚐喜怒哀樂之後又是數不盡的Troubles
Everyday有多少問題要去面對
有多少夜 痛苦煩惱著你無法入睡  法庭嚴肅的空氣逼得我快不能呼吸
 當時面臨著終生監禁的我開始反省
 鐵欄杆之後又是個截然不同的景象
 刑犯們眼神中看不到一點和平的氣象
 僅有一吋短的鉛筆 寫的是監獄風雲
 日記上描繪的不是美好的戶外風景
 自由在他們眼裡才是僮憬
 放一把自製武器在枕頭旁 以防隨時有人偷襲
 有些人懷疑老婆在外偷情
 有些人把家人寄來的信件一張一張好好收集
 有些人二十四小時幾乎在床上休息
 有些人精神失常 因為受不了打擊
 三個月如火如荼的漫長等待已過去
 出獄後的我得面對三年的緩刑期
 這也好 一生中第一次感覺到幸福
 但是生命的考驗何止如此我不清楚
 我不知道接下來還有什麼會發生
 翻開報紙的新聞又是看到放火殺人
 還記得某年無意間發現的照片 上面有阿姨對人  施行口交的噁心畫面
 這簡直摧毀了她在我心目中的形象
 我無法忘懷照片中那笑容多麼淫蕩
 我抵抗 胸口存在著不安及惶恐
 我不斷聽到痛苦的聲音在內心怒吼 *Life's a Struggle 日子還要過
品嚐喜怒哀樂之後又是數不盡的Troubles
Everyday有多少問題要去面對
有多少夜 痛苦煩惱著你無法入睡 *Life's a Struggle 日子還要過
品嚐喜怒哀樂之後又是數不盡的Troubles
Everyday有多少問題要去面對
有多少夜 痛苦煩惱著你無法入睡  不論我走到天南 不論我走到地北
 不論我走到哪都見識到人心的虛偽
 It's Kinda Funny 在人的眼裡只有Money
 外表好像要幫你 卻只是想幫他自己
 笑容可掬的臉後面 誰知道是個狼心狗肺
 連朋友都能背叛 因為只有名利合他口味
 她說她愛你的時候講的是問心無愧
 搞不好她愛的是你身後的榮華富貴
 你可曾困惑 在你身旁誰是敵是友
 對你落井下石的可能就是你的'摯友'
 你可曾經歷 當你最需要幫助的時候
 平常跟你稱兄道弟的人都突然失蹤
 親愛的神 偉大的神
 你可以怪我想法太過無知 但我只是人
 我不信人 因為人也不信我 不要問我為什麼
 我最多只能告訴你這就是我
 生命像海浪一樣有時高有時低
 你是否告訴自己堅強渡過各種時期
 我從命運的天台放眼卻看不到星空
 漆黑的天空壓在頭頂使我不得輕鬆
 在我心中 找不到一個安靜的角落
 我不能再沉睡下去 良心彷彿在笑我
 它在說: 有幾天幾夜老媽曾經為你以淚洗面
 老爸他只顧己見 希望之火只見熄滅
 我接起電話 是老爸憔悴的聲音
 雖沒見面卻不難想像他當時的神情
 剛聽完他最近失業的消息
 腦海裡馬上浮現祖母的話 警告我一定要爭氣
 我已經放棄所有哭的理由
 因為我早就習慣冷漠活在無情的現實裡頭
 人生要如何起頭? 改變要如何起手?
 當活在泥沼中 要如何才能金盆洗手?  *Life's a Struggle 日子還要過

 Life's a struggle (did u feel,man) ","When I opened my eyes entering this world
Mom gave me life, now I have to live and die alone
It makes me sick, it seems like everyone is wearing a mask
I think in the past, will my life continue like this?
I smoked so much that my lungs are black
Black as suffocating society opinion fog
I'm carrying my cross on my shoulders
And I thirst for power paper and respect.
I think this is probably just human nature
Buddhists say that agony is enlightenment, I do not want to talk about it
Honestly, I just want to crawl back into the womb
Mom, sorry for always getting you so angry.
You say you should have aborted me when you had the chance.
Every time I get home from school, I throw my backpack on the floor.
No one is at home, only their persistent perfume
I know tonight you have to work overtime again
I open the refrigerator, start eating cold dinner
Dad comes home stupidly drunk at two in the morning
I wake up from my sleep to hear you two arguing.
How should I focus on school tomorrow?
The teacher does not like me, and I do not like the teacher.
I hate these uniforms, I hate the school system.
I hate the face at first, I hate living in a prison.
That's right, a lot of people do not like my attitude
They say I'm really cool, cops already in my case hate me so they arrested me
I don't give a fuck about what other people say
They can think whatever they want, who are they?
No one has the right to judge me
What is important is to be myself, what do they think
It's still me, girls who love money only fuck the rich
If you are too stupid that you do not know how to use condoms you should not hate children
Money is powerful but you can not take it with you when you die
All these people clenching their fists, when will they let go? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? I almost suffocate in the dead air of the court
Facing a life sentence, I finally began to think
Behind bars, nothing is the same
There is no peace in the eyes of the damned
Just an inch of pencil to draw comic from prison
No one sees magazines about beautiful landscapes
The only thing they expect is freedom.
Putting guns done by yourself under your pillows just by chance
Some think their wives are cheating them
Some collect house letters
Some were in bed twenty-four hours a day
And some get crazy under all the pressure
Three months of waiting have already passed
After I left prison I still have to face three years of pardon
Okay, for the first time in my life I feel happy.
I do not know why my trials ended like this.
And I do not know what will happen in the future.
I open the newspaper, it's still fire and murder.
I remember the year I accidentally found those photographs
Photos of an ugly scene of auntie sucking a man
I've never seen her but it wrecks her image in my heart.
I'll never forget your wretched smile.
I fight the fear and the restlessness in my stomach.
But I constantly hear the suffering roar in my heart. * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? It does not matter if I walk south in the sky or north on land
All I can find is the hypocrisy of mankind
It's kind of funny, people only have money
It seems they want to help, but they just want to help themselves
Behind their smiling faces, no one knows how selfish they are.
Even friends can betray, when only fame will satisfy their taste
When she says she loves you, she has a clear conscience
But what she really loves is her power. You've probably wondered who your real enemies are.
What kicks when you're down could be an old friend
You'll find out when you need help more
Those who usually call him ""brother"" simply disappear
God loved, mighty God
You can blame me for thinking that way, but I'm just human
I do not trust people because they do not trust me.
Do not ask why - all I can say is that it's me
Life is like the sea, it has high tides and low tides.
It does not matter if you tell yourself that you will survive each cycle
From the mountain peak of fate, I could not see any stars
Just a silent black sky pressing me to the ground
In my heart I can not find a single quiet corner
I can not sleep, my conscience is fucking with me
She says: How many days and nights did your mother cry for you?
Dad only cares for himself, I want to fire just to watch him burn
I pick up the phone and hear your tired voice.
I can not see him, but it's not hard to imagine his face.
When I finish listening to your last job loss story
Grandpa's words are in my head: I have to fight
I've thrown away every excuse to cry
I am accustomed to living coldly in this relentless reality
What can I do to raise my head? What can I do to raise my hands?
I'm in the middle of a swamp, how can I get clean? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? * Life's a struggle, but you still have to face the days
You've tried everything but still have countless troubles
Everyday, how many problems should you face?
How many nights will you be awake with fear and pain? Life's a struggle Yeah

So, when you leave
You should smile and put the memories in your heart
Life is infinitely small, yet infinitely large
You spend your entire life on seeking or moving on
It's enough to arouse desire Dear traveller
The way you look still matches my memory of you
Walking through crowds, walking through this carnal world
Going on yet more journeys, to farther away places

Only my destruction remains in the lonely night.  *Lies are like flowers cascading from the sky
I witnessed your dubious relationship with him
My heart is withering gradually
Breaks quietly  *,** If, my dear, heartache,
Loveless concern and
Hard love are all in vain
Just let me feel your tenderness once more  *,** If he is more suitable for you to lean on
How to withdraw myself form the sorrow wholeheartedly?
Love is no longer relevant  Repeat *,** ",hankeat,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/hankeat

像昨天 今天同时在放映
我这句语气 原来好像你
不就是我们爱过的证据 差一点 骗了自己骗了你
爱与被爱不一定成正比
我知道被疼是一种运气
但我无法完全交出自己 努力为你改变
却变不了 预留的浮现
以为在你身边 那也算永远
仿佛还是昨天
可是昨天 已非常遥远
但闭上双眼 我还看得见 可惜不是你 陪我到最後
曾一起走却走失那路口
感谢那是你 牵过我的手
还能感受那温柔 那一段 我们曾心贴着心
我想我更有权力关心你
可能你 已走进别人风景
多希望 也有 星光的投影 感谢那是你 牵过我的手
还能温暖我胸口 ","All of sudden I`m very familiar with this moment
It seems that yesterday and today are on the show together
The tone of my voice is just like yours
Aren`t they the witnesses of our love I`ve almost cheated you and myself
To love and beloved might not be equally important
I know it is fortunate to be cared and loved
But I just can`t completely put my heart into I try to change myself for you
But I can`t change the destiny
I once thought I could always be by your side
It seems to be yesterday
But it has already gone far away
I can still see it when i close my eyes It`s a pity you are not the one, who accompany me till the end
We used to walk together but lost at the crossing
I`m grateful to you, who held my hands
Touch my heart with tenderness We used to be so close
I think I have more rights to care about you
Perhaps your heart has belonged to someone else
How I wish the stars can shine upon you I`m grateful to you, who held my hands
Keep my heart warm forever ",ideologypeng,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/ideologypeng

didn`t take away the loneliness

The fireworks won`t be perfect
When memories turns into ashes
The end has not yet come
She said it would be alright

Never pants and still have the same appearance
I wish on uncle's trades
His business gets famous across the four seas and can afford an expensive apartment Swaggering
Optimism helps you get rid of disasters

我的上辈子是李白 看我写歌那么厉害
所以不会感到奇怪 十二点的时候叫我起来

不是和尚念经 也不可能变心
桌子上面放的麻将 一瓶老干妈的辣酱
外地人会受不了的辣 嘴巴开始发烫
咋个样 麻辣烫 回到属于我的Chinatown

Training lets me get the feel and within minutes it's a K.O
Tell me I'm good opposite the stage of the music festival
Made in China fairytale-like lyrics come out
Waking up on a sunny day I walk into the recording studio full of determination and strength
The responsibility on my shoulders is that of the national team winning the swimming championships
Reality lets me learn many lessons and with that comes many dreans dreamt before

I was Li Bai in my past life, see how I write lyrics like a boss
So don't feel strange, call me up at twelve o'clock
With the accompaniment it's perfect, and we're so young
Not like the chanting monks, and we can't be fickle either
The mahjong on the table, a fucking hot chili sauce
Heat that the foreigners can't stand - a heat that makes your mouth burn
So what, that's mala hot, I return to my Chinatown
Four hands lion dance, it's time to light the cannon
You didn't expect it and got frightened by me, and on this topic

I think replacing our dreams with something else is impossible. That's right! To be honest I'm really sensitive sometimes
In this world.
Sincerity begets sincerity.
How many people have left us?
How many times have we felt safe?
This is due to the betrayal by people around us. I have grasped the essence of old habits long ago.
Life is a mixture of both truths and lies
In which you are faced with endless darkness.
I always have a clear conscience and live without fear.
We are flowers that never fade.
That's why, Lu Han, you are the most beautiful flower in the field. The calmer you wanna be,
The emptier you feel,

 I start to tell

 Only I know what every sleepless night means to me
 Before luckiness arrives eventually When sights cool down
 When trains stop

 Let him finish this song
 Before opening the door of shelter I believe someday when I turn back
 When I’m tired of the sky
 Want to fall into the ocean Someone will catch me when I fall
 I know
 Someone will catch me when I fall
 I know Are we all gonna get hurt,
 Or pretend or get lost
 No Will no one escape from getting hurt

As it flies to me at the speed of light
You allow me to see the North Star become a companion of the Cross Star I still have not gotten used to having your arm as my pillow
Your telescope cannot capture the loneliness of my northern hemisphere
The Pacific Ocean’s tide whirl along with Earth’s rotation
I will patiently wait, wait until the day you approach shore
I still have not gotten used to having your bosom as my warming stove
In the picture I e-mailed you, the loneliness of my northern hemisphere cannot be seen
No matter how big the world is, our sincerity will keep each other warm
My feelings of longing will not slack off; all of my dreams have been stored for you I still have not gotten used to having your arm as my pillow
Your telescope cannot capture the loneliness of my northern hemisphere
The Pacific Ocean’s tide whirl along with Earth’s rotation

Held my hand and stroked my hair.

You didn't want I give up on my dreams.
Really wanted me to be persistent
And not lose my hope. You should see me
On a large and wide stage,
Singing in a loud voice. I want you to be proud of me,
Grandma, grandma, grandma!
Want to return to your arms,
Grandma, grandma, grandma! The moon is shining. Grandpa is sitting inside.
Grandpa came out to buy some food. Grandma is sitting inside.
Grandma came out to embroider, to embroider glutinous rice cakes. I miss you, I miss you! You said you wanted me to sing to you.
I held back my tears.
Wanted to open my mouth but I couldn't breathe.
Wiped away the tears in front of you,
But you shed tears
And slowly closed your eyes. You wanted me to be strong.
You didn't want I give up on my dreams.
Really wanted me to be persistent
And not lose my hope. You should see me

Could lead people to be lost in a reverie
A legend once said there is a lot of treasures on it
As well as hidden into bottomless chasm
Many people had put into eternal rest because of this,
Yet they died with their eyes open
No one knows if there were anyone had really climbed to the top
So the legend continues
Moment by moment, step by step, to get closer
It is so close yet worlds apart Day by day, year by year
Again and again, but nothing has changed
You might think it is only a legend
Not many people would believe it
Have you ever seen such pure white and majestic snow mountains
Ever so tempting, radiating its golden color
Either a smart person, a fool, or an honest person
And everyone you know
On the hillside, on the cliff
From the peak to the abyss, they're all within momentarily view The snowflakes are flying upward, fluttering in the air
Either a smart person, a fool, or an honest person
They are all someone you knew
On the hillside, on the cliff
At the highest cloud, all are in this world of us
Let the snowflakes fluttering
Do you ever remember at the foot of the mountain
There is a crystal clear lake
Legend said at the very bottom of the deep lake
There lies undiscovered ancient secrets ",nipersson,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/nipersson

Still remember your eyes under the red fallen leaves
Still remember our shy faces smiling to each other
The magic of the love at first glance just at the moment
Only when the world pauses everything as if for us
Can I squeeze more time in to kiss your forehead
How to write the following story of our scenario
Let the cast coins in wishing pool witness our wish Neither of us has ever thought of our actual result
So upset, you're still shirking
But who the hell did come to me and finally leave?
As I remember, who should've shrunk back by the Pool then? I regret nor having fallen in love with you
Nor the weakness of my sorrow now
Too young
I was too young
After the experience with you have I learnt to grow
After the confrontation with night did I start to await sunshine
Too young
I was too young
Too young x3
Young Again I return to the pool where we made our wish
You're no more by my side but still clear before my eyes
I will like to cast a coin to break the tranquility of water
Ticks and tocks, of tears or tolling time? Neither of us has ever thought of our actual result
So upset, you're still shirking
But who the hell did come to me and finally leave?
As I remember, who should've shrunk back by the Pool then? Too young x3

Ain't seen nothing like it.

They've been looking for it.
But I know where to find it. Jade!

There's no one more precious than you, you.
Only I know your beauty, you.

I know you like diamonds too.
But nobody shines like. It is different from the rest.
It is sparkling and crystal-clear,
The beauty of jade is the most precious.
It is different from the rest.
It is sparkling and crystal-clear,
Your beauty is the most precious of all. People who understand you, baby,
Have kindness, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom and trust.
You are unique one.
People who understand this are worthy. I need it.
Only you are perfect.
A gentleman doesn't pursue anyone but you,
A mysterious jade,
A perfect match. You belong by my side.
Keep you with me all the time.
I get lost in your eyes
But that's right where I reside
With my woo!
You still make me nervous but it's cool.
That's my fantastic baby, that's my woo! She always knows
What I want like she's psychic.
You're a superhero, baby,
Let me be your sidekick.
Ain't seen nothing like it.
Everything timeless.
They've been looking for it.
But I know where to find it, Jade!
Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade!
There's no one more precious than you, you.
Only I know your beauty, you.
But nobody shines like. (Ever since I followed my king on his punitive expedition to the East and West) Jade!

And nobody shines like you.

There's the warm spring breeze, grass green as ever
Moonlight let love shine on the surface of the lake
Two people's campfire illuminate the whole night
How many years later, it will roam around like the clouds
The changing footsteps make us hard to hold hands
This whole life, there's me and you
Being engulfed in the night where moonlight shines like water Longing for that day, those days come back We want to stay by the Lake Baikal How man years later, the history follows the fleeting clouds
The fluttering snow cannot hold the tenderness
This whole life, there is too little time
Not enough to proof the deep affection that can melt the snow One day, you suddenly appear
You are so clear yet mysterious, by the Lake Baikal

 As happy as the movie ends at the cinema
 I was imprisoned in the memory

Following the tracks of a youngster's wandering
The moment before I leave the station
(I can't believe that) I am a little reluctant
I can't help but laugh about the complex feelings I have when nearing my home
It is unavoidable
And the sky of Nagano
is still so warm
The wind stirs up the past
When I first got to know this world
All the lingering
Watching the sky, which seemed close and within reach
and I was willing to travel through it no matter how hard the ordeal
Today, having walked throughout this world
all the lingering
turning the pages of time, having seen profiles of different faces
Without any warning, barging in to your smiling face
I used to be obsessed with how big the world was
And I used to wallow in its sleep talk
There was no way to know the truth, not struggling, not afraid to be laughed at
I had tumbled my youth into her
I had also plucked my strings into the height of summer
If it moves your heart, then let cosmic connection take you there
Walking against the light, letting the elements hit me
A short road, starting and stopping
There is a bit of distance
I don't know if what I caress is a story
or a session of a mood
Maybe what I expect is just
to rise up against time
To see you again
in the chilly morning light
Smiling happily
When I first got to know this world
All the lingering
Watching the sky, which seemed close and within reach
and I was willing to travel through it no matter how hard the ordeal
Today, having walked throughout this world
all the lingering
turning the pages of time, having seen profiles of different faces
Without any warning, barging in to your smiling face
I used to be obsessed with how big the world was
And I used to wallow in its sleep talk
There was no way to know the truth, not struggling, not afraid to be laughed at
I had tumbled my youth into her
I had also plucked my strings into the height of summer
If it moves your heart, then let cosmic connection take you there
The night wind makes the hair on your temples dance
Healing the scar that memories left behind
In your eyes
darkness and light mix
A smile of yours blossoms like a flower
The slight dusk darkness hides your staggering gait
Walking into the painting that's hidden in the headboard
In the painting, you have your head hung, talking
I still marvel at how big the world is
And I also revel in les mots d'amour of my childhood
There is no such thing as ""right or wrong"" left, not struggling, whether or not I get made fun of doesn't matter
I have finally returned my youth to her
along with the height of summer that I created with my plucking
If it moves your heart, then let cosmic connection take you there
In the name of love, are you still willing? ",BendersB,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/bendersb

Yeah, yeah, falling in my motion (splash!)  We enjoy the posture we are looking at. Every time.
Like a star, there is no need for a code. Stop hitting my line.
Dream sand tower. But I'm still not satisfied.
Of course, on the regular.
Just make the rules unexpected Irregular. We make the world go. I overlook the sky.
We make the world go.
I bet on all the world I want it.  Multi-coloured diamonds like the rainbow.
PLR your eyes and colour co-construction (Your brain go)
Yeah sparkling we flash can't be self let's dance.
Body hair.
No songs, no dance uh.  (Oh, Woah) Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up.
This song is a spark in the night sky.
Let this melody Wave.
Do it our way.  We enjoy the posture we are looking at. Every time.
Like a star, there is no need for a code. Stop hitting my line.
Dream sand tower. But I'm still not satisfied.
Of course, on the regular.
Just make the rules unexpected Irregular. We make the world go.

but you were not near me so I wish all good for you Time flies slowly, Don't let you grow older
I wish what I can do to make you live longer
The whole life you are so stubborn, what can I do do for you
Endless care, Please take it all Thanks for what you have done and support for our family
You try your best to give all best to me
