我会告别 告别我自己

后会无期 - The Continent
Lyrics: Han Han
Composer: Arthur Kent & Dee Sylvia
Translation: Orleusa - 欧丽娟 When a boat sinks in the ocean
When someone becomes
a mystery
You don't know
Why they suddenly left
And goodbye was actually the last word
When a car disappears in
the horizon
When someone becomes a mystery
You don't know
Why they suddenly left
As you didn't know that was the end
Just like the stars abandon the Galaxy every night
I will say good-bye, bid my own farewell
Because I don't know
I don't wanna know
The distance of being together
When a car disappears in
the horizon
When a person becomes
a mystery
You don't know
Why they suddenly left
As you didn't know that was the end
Like in a dream where the Galaxy plunges into the valley
I will wake up to forget my dreams
Because you don't know
You don't wanna know
What has passed is already lost
When a boat sinks in the ocean
When a person becomes a mystery
You don't know
Why they suddenly left
And goodbye was actually the last word
When a car disappears in the horizon
When a person becomes a mystery
You don't know
Why they suddenly left
As you didn't know that was the end ",Orleusa_欧丽娟,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/orleusa%E6%AC%A7%E4%B8%BD%E5%A8%9F

你美眷如花
我浪迹天涯
为我泡杯花茶
和你有些不搭
气氛开始有一点尴尬
你腼腆一笑
竟如此融洽
我情不自禁会为你牵挂
什么时代
早已经不想回家 你微微一笑
蝴蝶为你倾倒
凝眸几秒
不知道该干嘛
你拂袖模样
情千变万化
一壶好酒
趁着夜还未央
独自品尝
这大把好时光
夜深人静
略显一丝凄凉 东奔西走
微醺不宜骑马
听着浪人
弹着断了弦的琵琶
路过青楼酒馆
官人进来坐坐好吗
我的思念
似六月里的小雨哗哗
对你情有所钟
为你两袖清风 小生的花伞还落在你家

早已经不想回家 我化成风
不舍一帘美梦
醉醒穿梭

心动则心痛 ","Young lad me, my flower-print umbrella which I forgot, still lays in your home
You're gorgeous
and I travel the world
You brew a cup of floral tea for me
It seems like an odd action for you,
the atmosphere gets a bit awkward
You give a timid smile,
it feels just right
I can't help but miss you
Who cares what era this is
It's been long that I hadn't wanted to go home You give a slight smile
Butterflies fall for you
Gawking for a few seconds
Not knowing what to do
Your slowly moving your sleeve
accompanies thousands of changes in your expression
A pot of good brew (of alcohol)
While the night is still young
Tasting on my own
a great deal of a good time
late in a quiet night
it seems a bit melancholy Travelling here and there
When you're tipsy is not a good time to ride a horse
Listening to a diaspora playing a broken-stringed pipa
Passing by hospitality,
Would you please come in and sit for a while? My longing for you
is like the pattering of June rain
I love only you
I stay blameless for you Young lad me, my flower-print umbrella which I forgot, still lays in your home
You're gorgeous
and I travel the world
You brew a cup of floral tea for me
It seems like an odd action for you,
the atmosphere gets a bit awkward
You give a timid smile,
it feels just right
I can't help but miss you
Who cares what era this is
It's been long that I hadn't wanted to go home I turn into wind
Not wanting to let go of my dream
Alternating between wakefulness and drunkenness
In the end, I am left with nothing
If it weren't for you,
in this lifetime, how would I ever know that:
if a diaspora glances back,
falling (for a person) would certainly mean heartache? ",BendersB,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/bendersb

every rainy season
What you choose to forget
is what I am attached to the most
Short paper, long love

好像帶給我一點點懷念
巷尾老爺爺賣的熱湯麵
味道瀰漫過舊舊的後院
流浪貓睡熟在搖晃鞦韆
夕陽照了一遍他咪著眼
那張同桌寄的明信片
安靜的躺在課桌的里面 快要過完的春天
還有雕刻著圖案的門簾
窄窄的長長的過道兩邊
老房子依然升起了炊煙
剛剛下完了小雨的季節
爸媽又一起走過的老街
記不得哪年的哪一天
很漫長又很短暫的歲月 現在已經回不去
早已流逝的光景
手裡的那一張漸漸模糊不清的車票
成了回憶的信號 忘不掉的是什麼我也不知道
想不起當年模樣
看也看不到 去也去不了的地方
也許那老街的腔調是屬於我的憂傷
嘴角那點微笑越來越勉強 忘不掉的是什麼我也不知道
放不下熟悉片段
回頭望一眼 已經很多年的時間
透過手指間看著天
我又回到那老街
靠在你們身邊漸行漸遠 ","A few faded photographs
Gave me a little bit of nostalgia
The hot noodle soup that the old grandpa at the end of the alley sells
The taste diffuses through the old backyard
The wandering cat sleeps on the rocking swing
The sunset shines on its eyes
The postcard sent by the kid at the same table
Quietly rests inside the school desk The spring days that are about to be over
The door still have the carvings on them
The two sides of the narrow and long aisle
The smoke coming from the old house
The drizzle that just finished from the rainy season
Dad and mom walked through the alley again
Can't remember what year and what day
A really long yet really short time Now it is too late to return to
The scene that has long gone
The train ticket that is slowly becoming faded in your hand
Became a symbol of the memory I don't know what not forgetting is like
I can't remember what it was like back then
The place I can't see or visit even if I wanted to
Perhaps the accent of the old street is part of my sadness
The smile at the corner of my mouth is becoming harder and harder I don't know what not forgetting is like
Unable to put down the familiar fragments
Turned around and looked and it's been so many years
Looking through my fingers at the sky
I am back to the old street
Leaning by your side but slowly drifting away ",panda88,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/panda88

What's the point of assigning blame?
Your lies are based on the fact you still love me. Beautiful bubbles, although temporary

If you can see through it, what is there to be sad about? I should have known that bubbles break at the touch
Just like a broken heart that can't endure torture
It's nobody's fault

All your promises, although too fragile

Even the brightest stars will fall after they shoot pass
Isn't love just a bubble
If you can see through it, what is there to be sad about? Why be sad? What is there to be sad about? It's all just bubbles, all just temporary
All your promises, are all too fragile
And it's my fault for not seeing through you
Which is why I'm so heartbroken How can I search again for the embrace of love
If I embrace loneliness, does this mean that I wouldn't be lonely?
Isn't love just a bubble, it's my fault for not seeing through it
Which is why I'm so heartbroken Bubbles under the rain will break at the touch
And that burning passion in my heart has long died

两个人的回忆
雨过之後
更难忘记
忘记我还爱你 你不用在意
流泪也只是刚好而已
我早已经待在谷底 我知道不能再留住你
也知道不能没有骨气
感激你
让我拥有秋天的美丽 看着那白色的蜻蜓
在空中忘了前进
还能不能
重新编织
脑海中起毛球的记忆 再说我爱你
可能雨也不会停
黑色毛衣
藏在哪里
就让回忆永远停在 那里 ","A black sweater
The memories of two people
After the rain has passed
It is even harder to forget
Forget that I still love you You don't have to mind
The tears only just happened to be falling
I was already waiting at the bottom of the valley long ago I know I cannot keep you from leaving anymore
And I know I must have a backbone
I am thankful to you
For letting me possess the beauty of autumn Watching that white dragonfly
In the air it forgets to go forward
Can I still
Reweave
The memories that are pilling in my mind Say I love you again
Perhaps the rain won't stop
The black sweater
Where is it hidden?
Then just let the memories stop there forever ",wuhuahua089,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/wuhuahua089

Who would want blood flowing like the dripping wax on a wedding night.
Oh! It's my fault that you must suffer the same fate as me.
Let us be true to the age-old customs, bowing deeply to each other,
And drink together from these wedding cups before we enter the grave, our wedding chamber.
So that future generations will praise my prince in songs and stories. M: I pretend this canopy of weeping willows are the curtains of our bridal chamber

M: Raising our cups together this very night we move on.

He will marry the young sweet lady who he love dearly and form a family.
I wish that they would not go through poverty and suffer just like me.''  This were the words written on my Dad's diary.

One mouthful one mouthful eat fallen worries. Whoosh~~ Carrying you,As if carrying sunshine.
No matter where we go,it's also a sunny day.
Butterfly is comfortably flying,Sky is covered with flowers.
Each bud each bud is nice smelling because of you.
Try letting the setting sun hover.
Leading you and I to circle nature.
Meeting the wind,Starting to share together each day.
Hand by hand,1 step 2 steps 3 steps 4 steps,watching the sky.
Looking at stars,1 star 2 stars 3 stars 4 stars joined together to form a line.
Back to back,Quietly make a wish.
Look at the distantly placed stars if they can hear.

To strike a conversation is too embarrassing (I'm foolishly looking at you) Just like blown-up bubbles

The bigger it grows, the more transparent it is
It's so transparent

Blowing and exploding within the heart

I am behind the door,pretending that you have not left yet.
Old days like being revisited, full moon even lonelier.
Half conscious candle in the night, can't bear to criticise me severely. A pot of a wanderer,Wander about far away from home,hard to swallow.
After you left,the recollection of the warmth of wine recalls being thin.
The water flows towards the east,how to steal time?
Flowers bloom and mature once,yet I missed it. Who is using the lute to play,the song ""East Wind Breaks""?
Times and seasons peeled off the wall,see when I was small.
Still remember that year we were still very young.
And nowadays the sound of the piano is spooky.
My waiting,You have not heard yet.
Who is using the lute to play,the song ""East Wind Breaks""?
The maple leaf dyes the story, I see through the ending.
I lead you through the ancient path outside of the fence.
The year of desolation,that even separation is very silent. A pot of a wanderer,Wander about far away from home,hard to swallow.

Watch how I’m going to
Test the limit and break through

Let it go, let it go
I will be hurt no more
A new world is in front of me
Let the torrential rain pour My power is strong and flutters from the ground up into the sky
My heart is frozen layer by layer, the sharp fragments are hard to remove
A thought sparks, it crystalizes, reshaping my world
The future is waiting
I won’t linger in the past  Let it go, let it go
Behind the dark clouds is the light of dawn
Let it go, let it go
All that's left is the echo of memories
A new world, hope is in front of me

This alias is our last line of defense
Media incites us, it spews out two-page sensations
Trying to uncode photographs with these two eyes Nightingale turns silent, you folks've worked real hard
Who dares not to obey what has been diligently washed in Puts your paws up, take to gas, take to sulfuric acid
Shave your head, open your eyes, hit the keyboard How will you remember me?
As a nymph, as your booty call or as enslaved by prostituting myself?
Keeping my head calm, flattering up folks, being absurdly amusing, warding off hate and jealousy.
Mustn't allow hatred rule over one's noggings Hide my name, forget my name
The identical tragedy refuses to cease, it flashes on and on
Imprisoning my body and cutting my tongue off
Silently wanting to weave tears into silk, turning tears into beauty
Oh Rushing into the sewer, sinking into the riverbed straight off a wedding reception,
Full of suitcases, refrigerators standing on the balcony
At school, at the factory, on the roadside What a ’good place’ chosen by the pillow
How will you bury me in the snow of your memory?
Will I go down as a nymph, a booty call or as the enslaved prostitute?
Keeping my head calm, flattering up folks, being absurdly amusing, warding off hate and jealousy
Circumsing one's soul open, its blood joining into the blood stream Hide my name, forget my name
The identical tragedy refuses to cease, it flashes on and on
Imprisoning my body and cutting my tongue off
Silently wanting to weave tears into silk, turning tears into beauty
Oh We aren't really called Little Juans
This alias is our last line of defense
Over a cup of tea idle conversationing gets turned into a sport
In such great hurry dismissed, put matters to rest Know my name, remember my name
When the same tragedy ceases completely
Bury my body and smoothen my brows
Silently polish my tombstone with your tears Know my name, remember my name
Why does the same tragedy has to continue?
Bury my dreams, stitch my heart together
Silently etched into the tombstone with tears I may remain

Defeat hypocrisy with a heart of gold. Too many tears in both hands to separate them.
Let us look at each other with clear eyes.
Maybe love doesn't happen as you wish in life.
Morning wind doesn't cure a hangover. Whose tears have dyed the stamen red?
Feeling sad with the head down hearing the sounds of windy rain.
Unwilling to bloom alone again(be alone again).
The future awaits.
Day after day. Who doesn't sleep in the middle of night?
Sitting by the window,feeling the autumn wind blowing through the palace curtain.
Persistently thinking of past relationships.

 I won’t assume what the future holds
Confused, so I just pretend to be nonchalant
Deliberately avoid friendly greetings
Holding back my feelings,
So others won’t see through my sadness.
It was hands of fate
That orchestrated the way you came to me
You quietly invaded my hollow heart
My silence, my feelings, you understand it all. So moved. No words needed
Don’t fear. Though the world is cold, when I think of you with you by my side.
Every corner of my heart is illuminated,
That long dormant love gets awakened.
Under the starry night sky you draw out the tenderness in me
Holding your hands tight I vow to be with you forever
Empty city, empty streets walking alone
But heading towards you, I will never get lost again
Crossing each other’s paths in the vast crowd
I believe you are still waiting for me
We share the same dedication
My heartbeat, my feelings, you understand it all. How lucky. No words needed.
Don’t fear. Though the world is cold, when I think of you, with you by my side,
Every corner of my heart is illuminated, that long dormant love gets rekindled
Under the starry night sky, you draw out the tenderness in me
Holding you hands tight I vow to be with you forever
Don’t fear. Though the world is cold,
When I think of you, with you by my side,
Let’s indulge in love, believing that warmth can melt down any sorrow
Under the starry night sky you draw out the tenderness in me,
Holding you hands tight I vow to be with you forever VIDEO SUBS VERSION
Unwilling to assume that I will never know
I don’t know why I pretend to be free and easy.
Deliberately dodging
I’m so sad that I’m not obsessed with it.
Have a pair of destiny hands
Arranged with you
Empty heart, you quietly landed
My silence, you will understand, feel it all.
More moving, no need to say
Not afraid of the world, indifference, think of you, accompany me.
Illuminate the corner of my heart, resurrect the sleeping love
Sticking to the starry sky at night, being softened by you
Hold your hand tightly, make sure to accompany you to the end.
Empty city alley, it is inevitable to walk alone
Have your direction, no more confused
Crisscrossing in the sea
I am sure you are still waiting for me.
So the same, our persistence
My heartbeat, you will understand, feel it all.
How lucky, don't need to say
Not afraid of the world, indifference, think of you, accompany me.
Illuminate the corner of my heart, resurrect the sleeping love
Sticking to the starry sky at night, being softened by you
Hold your hand tightly, make sure to accompany you to the end.
Not afraid of the world, indifference, because you love me.

My yearning for you is like a thorn that nailed me down. Because you always remind me
that even if I win the whole world, I'll miss some kind of happiness. Do you remember the scorching summer?
Who else has reached the path that I didn't choose in the end? ",lakoje,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lakoje

There’s the fragrance of a hundred decaying leaves. The beauty of a rose is to be admired by itself.
Into the earth to grab ahold of lightness.
Precious deep thoughts gain uniformity.
The power of thought urges an immature heart to become mature.
In illusion and dream one dreams of maturing hurriedly~The circle of Taiji(yin & yang) rotates by a rule~Break away from the continuous cycle from right where you are. Ah~Ah~
Seems easy. Yet a raging fire comes through the throat.
Paint a oil-paper flower umbrella. Compete for masks. Change the face you put on.
Ah~Ah~
Kowtow(bow) for rewards. First visit to view spring. Take the path of benevolence.
It’s rare in a century. To meet a friend who knows one well.
Circle around in tiny steps to climb up the highest skies amongst clouds.
Make circles in a futile effort to make it to the highest skies amongst clouds.
Continue to stand there and cry by singing a song of longing.
Thoughts disturb and so look back quickly. The circle of Taiji(yin & yang) rotates by a rule~Break away from the continuous cycle from right where you are. Ah~Ah~
Seems easy. Yet a raging fire comes through the throat.

Let me take off your heart
Try to melt it slowly
let me see if I am still perfect in your heart
wheather you still miss me a little bit
that you still cannot helping love me
It there any place  in your heart that I have not been? At that place the lake is always clean
At that place the air is full of peace
White moon shines on the earth
Hiding the memories that you do not want to talk about You said true love always can start over
true love always can last for ever
Why is still there the loneliness in your eyes?
Maybe I am some kind of sustenance for you
to fill the blank of your heart.
When will you allow me to stay in the forest of your heart? 2.
At that place the lake is always clean
At that place the air is full of peace
White moon shines on the earth
Hiding your deepest secret 3.
I might not ask
That makes ripples on your calm mind again
But my love is beyond the border
and I want to have all of you
I should not ask
I should not have let you revisit the past again
But how can I break free from the shackles of my heart? Repeat 1,2,3,3 ",pabloli,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/pabloli

With aplomb and ease exuding from every stride
My face would gleam with fearless innocence
Itching to fix the entire world I once harbored fantasies about growing up
""An ordinary yet happy life""
Turned out to be much simpler said than done
Those dreams now lay scattered in far-flung corners of the earth
No choice but to let go of those I love deeply Expectations fade into disappointment
Nursing my wounds in loneliness
Hugging you has exhausted what strength I have
From now on, I will flourish for myself
Must stay strong after bidding farewell
Must never give in despite the wounds
That silhouette will guide my every step
From now on, I wander with myself What is the price of growing up?
At best it means burying freedom with our own hands
Why must we be so stubborn in love
And yet sacrifice the very self we started out with Come the end, we must be worlds apart
Only now do I realize I no longer have a safe haven backing me
We only got to cross paths once in this lifetime
My only wish is to leave behind bright days ahead for you Expectations fade into disappointment
Nursing my wounds in loneliness
Hugging you has exhausted what strength I have
From now on, I will flourish for myself
Must stay strong after bidding farewell
Must never give in despite the wounds
That silhouette will guide my every step
From now on, I wander with myself Perhaps my heart still aches with reluctance
How I yearn for time to stop at this instant
In the end, the realization finally dawns on me
The path ahead is meant for me to walk alone ",aliengator,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/raouiyeh

She remembered the prompting whistles at the train station
Playing my songs and joining people in tears
Joining people in tears She came to my concert
At the age of 25 being in love was like savoring sunny days
Her boyfriend sent roses to other girls behind her back
She rejected all his calls and stayed up every night listening to songs My songs made her swoon and heart-broken
Adults always pretend to be unaffected by breaking up
She got drunk with friends at the karaoke bar
Singing my songs and watching the screen in tears
Watching in tears My songs made her swoon and heart-broken
At the age of 33 true love was so precious
A younger girl asked her to step aside
And let her man decide with whom to carry on
Who carried on then My songs made her swoon and heart-broken
She strived not to make herself look tired
Time is listening to us singing about ""no regrets""
While others are clapping we'll sing till in tears
Sing till in tears She came to my concert
Women who still listen to songs after 40 are beautiful
Her child asked why there were tears on her face

可是我真的不夠勇敢　
總為你忐忑為你心軟
畢竟相愛一場
不要誰心裡帶著傷 ＃我可以永遠笑著扮演你的配角
在你的背後自己煎熬
如果你不想要
想退出要趁早
我沒有非要一起到老
我可以不問感覺繼續為愛討好
冷眼的看著你的驕傲
若有情太難了
想別戀要趁早
就算迷戀你的擁抱
忘了就好 Repeat ＊　＃ 愛已至此
怎樣的說法　
都能成為理由
我在這樣的愛情裡看見的　
是我們的軟弱 ","At the end I realize that loving you is a habit
I've learned how to tell you the same lies
You always want me next to you
Saying what happiness should look like
The heaven that you give me
Is actually desolated * If I could’ve made a clean break with you sooner
We wouldn’t have to be struggling to be in love
But I'm really not brave enough
Always feel perturbed and give in to you
For the sake of we have been in love
Don’t want pain to linger in anybody’s heart # I can smile forever and act as your supporting cast
Then agonize behind you by myself
If you don’t want this
Do it soon if you want to back out
It’s not necessary for us to be together 'til old
I can ignore my feelings and continue to please you
Staring coldly at your arrogance
it will be difficult once the sentiment is formed
Do it soon if you want to find someone else
Even if I am obsessed with your embraces
Once forgotten - everything will be fine Repeat * # Love has come to this point
What you say of it
Would be reasonable
What I see from the way this love goes
Are our weaknesses ",lx512,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lx512

不如喝完这杯就各自回家
别坐在对面欣赏我的挣扎 一场失败的爱情像个笑话
热的时候心乱如麻
冷了以後看见自己够傻
人怎麽会如此容易无法自拔 一场无味的爱情像个谎话
甜的时後只相信它
苦了以後每一句都可怕
人怎麽会如此难以了无牵挂 ","The flavor's too strong, isn't it,
Or else why would it be so bitter we can't speak?
Everytime, I'm all alone, asking myself
""Is our love really still there?"" Or maybe the flavor's already gone,
Even if we put in more sugar it wouldn't get any better.
Maybe it's best that after drinking this cup, we each go our own way
Don't sit across from me and enjoy my suffering! Chorus:
A failed love is like a joke,
When it was hot, I couldn't get my mind to think properly.
But after it cooled down I see that I was so stupid..
Why do people get trapped so easily? A flavorless love is like a lie,
When it's sweet, you only believe in it.
After it becomes bitter, every sentence is torture..

Quickly passed. All those nagging worries and thoughts
Will escape your mind. Maybe you'll find a solution.

hence making that phone call
Missing you, haven’t met you for so long
The far away, strangling depression
Locked itself on my heart again
That release of our hands
I can only sigh, regretting letting you go That sudden greeting, my heart is trembling
Conflicting, the words in my heart are chained
I wanted to ask about the weather at your side, the sad emotions
The concealed concern, long betrayed by tears
Just by listening to your breath, it is the best consolation Touching you
Looking at the gentleness of the tears
If this continues, even memories won’t be able to console us
My tears keep falling we once had an agreement
If we break up and never meet again
When you are hurt, occasionally, let me hear your breath It’s hard to breathe, in everyday without you
I am still unwilling to face reality
My heart is really tired, but tomorrow still needs to go on
Afraid that you will feel he heartache hence hiding everything from you
Missing you with all my heart, thinking you will know Touching you
Looking at the gentleness of the tears
If this continues, even memories won’t be able to console us
My tears keep falling we once had an agreement
If we break up and never meet again
When you are hurt, occasionally, let me hear your breath Thinking too much about what I want to tell
Why am I remaining silent now?
No matter how much words, can we go back to how we were?
The heart is aching If we can go back to that blissful period
I’ll hold your hands tight I will not go easily Touching you
Looking at the gentleness of the tears
If this continues, even memories won’t be able to console us
My tears keep falling we once had an agreement
If we break up and never meet again
Every moment, constantly missing you
When it gets to tiring that I cannot tolerate anymore

How can I pair with you, for I lack a heart
The sound of the pan ling1 clear and melodious; the lights between the curtains shone dimly
We were meant for each other
It would be a sin if I lose you
It’s exactly because I lack a heart that I am a good match for you
You in tatters, while I in painted brilliance; side by side we walked through mountains and waters
Though you appear haggard, I will shine for you You were the one who kissed your brush and pen, and dyed the teardrop at the tail of my eye
For whom do we put on dramas of partings and unions, sadness and happiness?
They will misunderstand, but I will only be in your hands
Is there anything more perfect in this world? With the opera hand pose2, the water-like mortal world is pinched and twisted between fingers
On the red platform one meter tall3, having all stories told in songs
Singing farewell, it’s no longer called sadness when sadness prolongs; magnificent red reduced to ash grey
I wish we would all remember, the best years we had together. As you tug the strings you send me dancing in the air
As you lead I know how to go forth and back
In thick and thin I shall follow; be it my arms or legs you move, I will not disobey
Perfecting humility and gentleness If you are wrong I refuse to be right; if you are muddled, I am ignorant
How can the fire in my heart be happy to cease to boil
If you wilt I’ll never wither; if you are tired I dare not be fatigued
What can I use to warm you for a thousand years The blizzard vaguely resembles the whitened ends of your hair
The lights shone with lush brilliance, rubbing creases between your brows
If you are willing to give up one single teardrop
If I can be your company when you are old
Even if I am reduced to ash in a stream of smoke, I’d be perfectly happy to go. ",Georgankar,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/georgankar

Though we walk side by side it seems that we're separated by tides
Guess that if the storm before you collapses the city
Would you finally hear my heartbeat? If I had more courage if you had less hesitation
L'm curious by which place we would go Guess what the pendulum will bring to you
The sorrowful blank or the presence filled with love
Guess what will be revealed in the future!
The wonder with possibilities or the wait without results
Isn't it love? love
If not,you guess! love
I think it's love love
If not,you guess! love Is the distance between us perfect? Would I bother you if I get closer?
I guess dubious relationship is a gentle jail
Why the tempo gets in disorder and the earth suddenly shakes
I guess you surely know the answer sooner than I
If I had more courage if you had less hesitation
Would the answer be revealed Guess what the pendulum will bring to you
The sorrowful blank or the presence filled with love
Guess what will be revealed in the future!
The wonder with possibilities or the wait without results
Isn't it love? Guess what the pendulum will bring to you

There’re more than a thousand reasons to keep going about
I’m ignoring your murmurs, which have an invisible force over me You’re not a voice, only an insignificant tone
I’m busy, anyway
Just a made-up sound So many people are protected by the walls of our castle
So, mysterious siren, no, your call will remain unheard I’ve had adventures and I don’t need more
Do you think I want to risk all this and that I’ll follow you
On a new path
Towards an unknown world
Exploring the unknown? What do you want, when you're stealing away my sleep?
Are you here to scare me, till I feel abandoned?
Or are you a creature that’s a little bit like me?
Who could know better than I where do I come from? Every day is a little harder, the power of my magic grows
If into the vast world of the unknown I go
To come into the unknown
I want to believe in dreams
A hidden world So where are you?
Can't you please hear my voice?

At the time I haven't cut my long hair short
Without credit cards without her
Have a home without 24 hour hot water
But then I was so happy
Although with only a broken guitar
In the street, under the bridge, in the fields
Singing songs that nobody cares
If one day, I'm an old man
Please leave me there at that time
If one day, I leave quietly
Please bury me in the spring Remember the lonely spring
I have not grown a beard at that time
Without Valentine's day without gifts
Without my sweet little princess
I feel that nothing is so bad
Although I have only the illusion of love
In the morning, at night, in the wind
Singing songs that nobody cares
Maybe one day I'm old man
Please put me there at that time
If one day I leave quietly
Please bury me in the spring Now gazing the spring in full bloom
Looks like the old warm time
I cut long hair, grew a beard
The pain was all gone with wind
But I feel it is so sad
Lost years left me confusion
In this sunny spring
I could not help the tears flowing
Maybe one day I'm an old man
Please leave me there at that time
If one day I leave quietly
Please bury me in the spring If one day I am an old man
Please leave me there in the spring
If one day I leave quietly

从此我的心里有很多人就是没有你
度日如年
在玻璃上画出笑脸
而我是最好的演员
表演我不再留恋
就在这场游戏输光所有的筹码
所有承诺都作废了就当飞走啦
要赚更多的money换新的麦克风
要买Gucci和LV 但不会给你送

You lied to me, your eyes were red
Having issued a red card, I was punished
I was kicked out by you, alright
Did you listen carefully to what I said?
My serious feelings are waiting for an answer from the air
Do you really love me?
You didn't let me go with your kisses
Like a well-aimed shot,
You hit right to the heart, the heart1
Stop pretending, you're not the Mona Lisa
Last sweet words mixed with swearing She said I wasn't warm enough, so put on his2 coat
She wanted more freedom, and I was just her hobby
Teard up the past
Lost my temper
Deleted all the text messages
I was full of alcohol
Looked at the pointer swinging
All the memories of closing your eyes were solidified into ice
Girl I need a tattoo on my body
Drunk several cups of coffee
Music anesthetizes myself
Maybe this is the best match
Even if I saw your missed call, I was indifferent
I filled all the holes with new shoes and music
I need a new gold chain
Threw away the old one
I've long forgotten who you are
Who the hell forgot who
I got more fans
They love my perfume

Last sweet words mixed with swearing Once you were my necessity, but now it has been replaced by others
From then on, many people in my heart just don't have you
When a day goes like a year goes
Draw a smiling face on the glass
I am the best actor
I will no longer miss performing
In this game, all the chips are lost,
and all the promises are invalid and flew away
I want to earn more money to buy a new microphone
I'll buy Gucci and LV, but I won't give them to you
After you left,
It's easy for me every day
Right after you left,
Inspiration seems to be in full swing The plot is simply beautiful
You lied to me, your eyes were red

Never been mediocre
Never slacked off, yielded

I forge ahead and shake off fatigue
I bravely stride forward
Wake up the passions in my heart I cannot wander around anymore
Nor wait any longer
How helpless it is if one cannot heed reality
If the future is elusive
It's better to start a new era from now on If you want to win
You have to speed up
Prove yourself right now

I want to change the times Start through the dawn
Don't be discouraged
Take my courage
No need to worry

Adiao
Lives somewhere in Tibet,
Like a cinereous vulture,
Who inhabit the top of a mountain.
Adiao,
Sunshine is strewn all round the gateway of Jokhang Monastery,
Make a pot of sweet tea,
We are chatting about old times.
Adiao,
You always dress yourself up,
Like a boy,
As tenacious as Galsang flower(a kind of coreopsis).
Adiao,
Insincere people have thousands of types of smiles,
When will you go down the mountain,
Remember to take Zhuoma knife.
Under the gray hat brim,
Hollow cheek,
You seldom speak,
A brief answer,
Where is tomorrow,
And who's gonna care for you?,
Even if you die on the way…
Accept and exile,
Puzzled and free,
Just like the wind,
Blowing over the bumpy road.
Endless footsteps are whirling around,
Footprints are going on slowly,
Or won't leave even a trace here.
But I still won't,
Abandon hope just because of pain,
Wounds have changed into scars,
And blossomed into flowers of incomparable beauty,
Wounds have changed into scars,
And blossomed into flowers of incomparable beauty.
Adiao,
Will you have a full meal tomorrow,
You've gotten used to it,
Loneliness becomes faith.
Adiao,
Won't be worn away by reality,
You don't belong to this world,
There's no need to care about the truth.
Ill-fated,
Infatuated and composed
Waved goodbye to youth,
And countless stations,
Willing to be ordinary but unwilling,
To accept the ordinary failure,
You are adiao,
You are a free bird.
Ill-fated,
Infatuated and composed
Waved goodbye to youth,
And countless stations,
Willing to be ordinary but unwilling,
To accept the ordinary failure,
You are adiao…

You are a tree,
You will never perish. ",Luciano,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/luciano

I’m just scared that I can't withhold my tears I don't understand your black humor
I've thought it through, but you came and puzzled me again

Many of the romantic,
Many of them heartbreaking.
Reuniting and separating,
Many days reading and the book still unfinished.

Why else would you keep holding my hand?
You said you'd love to bring me to your hometown —
Green tiles and red bricks,
Willows and moss.
In the past and present,
Always the same.
You said you'd be like that too.

Getting close slowly,
Talking about ourselves slowly,
Being with you slowly,
I'd like pair with you slowly,
Give myself to you slowly.

Reminiscing slowly,
Growing slowly older with you slowly.
Because slowly is the best reason in itself.
Let's order a dessert you like after dinner;
You can have the right side of the bed tonight.
I want to go to a beach for a holiday this time —
Sneakers and a wristwatch,
The socks and shirt have already been ironed,
Put them in a suitcase.
I'll wait for you to wake up in the morning.

I put on a look of indifference
I'm pretending I'm strong, holding my sadness captive I thought I was letting go, unaffected
But I was only acting Turns out that it was me whose heart was pierced with a knife

Blood-red soaks all the night sky
From unspeakably splendid heartache My doubts and fears bring me endlessly lower
Too late to keep the sinking feelings from
Sinking for good** [Chorus]
That dream we had and we failed and we shared is now
Wasted on us both
We wake up standing at crossroads of freedom, not
Sure where we've come Leave me and let me go / Don't make me cry
Don't reveal I'm weak
Fake just a little loss / Break up well; say
It's not you, it's me All that talk about who had loved, who had hurt is
Pointless in the end
Wave goodbye to our promises / Won't ask you to
Get it, just don't make me cry [Verse 2]
Your heavy heart / What good does it do now?
Maybe that small bit of hurt
Leftover proves that our love was once real My callous heart deep down
Quietly aches with dull pain
Having shared our most vicious parting words
Let's part ways for good [Chorus 2]
That dream we had and we failed and we shared is now
Wasted on us both
We wake up standing at crossroads of freedom, not
Sure where we've come Leave me and let me go / Don't make me cry

離開你謊言回歸純粹 迷途禁地在你心裡
像闖迷霧森林般詭異
佈滿荊棘謊言的秘密
到底那一句才是真的你
你每句話讓我期待
至高點讓我俯瞰的傷害
Tell me 你最真實的狀態
就讓我醒來 墜入真實謊言
即興你的表演
敗給你又一遍
愛得無法揣測是非
Oh my dangerous dangerous 岌岌可危
懸掛在失控的邊界
敗給你又一遍
最真實的謊言 害怕你會不在身邊
Hey girl 讓我多相信一點
最後存在兩個世界
是你的謊言 墜入真實謊言
(Oh nanana) 即興你的表演
(Oh nanana) 敗給你又一遍
(Oh nanana) 愛得無法揣測是非
反覆無止盡的黑夜我不知道
懸掛在失控的邊界
敗給你又一遍 (Oh nanana)
最真實的謊言 (Oh nanana) 微妙的即興表演 (Oh nanana)
隔絕著你的甜蜜語言 (Oh nanana)
Oh come on and do it say you like that (Oh nanana)
Talk to me girl (告訴我吧)
Talk to me (Oh nanana 真實的話) ","Disappearing in an instant, leave in the morning
Girl, who slept peacefully
Misty eyes that can`t see the boundary properly, woo
Can`t reach the finish line (A little, a little)
Storyline is slow motion (Sweet lies)
Stubborn love isn`t perfect, no more Floating to your world
Chasting your line of sight
Lost on the other side in the forest of line Falling into true lies
Free styling your performance
Losing to you once again
Loving to the point it`s impossible to guess right or wrong
Oh my dangerous dangerous placed in jeopardy
Suspended on the edge of losing control
Losing to you once again
The truest lies Oh nanana (Will you tell me)
Oh nanana (Truthful words)
Oh nanana (Tell me)
Oh nanana (True lies) Almost unable to remember your face, gradually blurring
Looking at you for the last time, familiarising
You left my world`s freezing temperature
Left your lies returning to purity Lost in the forbidden land of your heart
Like the weirdness of rushing into the fog of the forest
Secrets filled with lies full of thisles and thorns
Which sentences is real you
Your every sentence me anticipate
To the highest point allowing me to overlook the damage
Tell me your realest state
Just let me wake up Falling into true lies
Free styling your performance
Losing to you once again
Loving to the point it`s impossible to guess right or wrong
Oh my dangerous dangerous placed in jeopardy
Suspended on the edge of losing control
Losing to you once again
The truest lies Scared of you not being by my side
Hey girl, let me be more confident
In the end existing in two words
It`s your lies Falling into true lies
(Oh nanana) Freestyling your performance
(Oh nanana) Losing to you once again
(Oh nanana) Loving to the point it`s impossible to guess right or wrong
I don`t know he dark night that repeatedly has no limits
Suspended on the edge of losing control
Losing to you once again (Oh nanana)
It`s the trues lies (Oh nanana) The subtle freestyle performance (Oh nanana)
Cutting off your sweet language (Oh nanana)
Oh come on and do it say you like that (Oh nanana)
Talk to me girl (Tell me)
Talk to me (Oh nanana, truthful words) ",chittaphrr,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/chittaphrr
