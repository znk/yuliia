Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up Callin'
Something in the way you wanna talk 你的秘密 总是安静
藏着魅力
等待被开启
无预警
就像两颗沉默的流星 是奇迹 跨越人们
无法想象的距离
而你仿佛仍迟疑
怕太急 是否会伤害你
保护的心 (Catch a flight)
但身体隐约传递出的讯息 Yeah
早已不经意出卖你 呼唤渴望的幽灵 Ey
向月光借一点勇气 Ey
唇边颤抖的阴影
仿佛充满好奇却在故作镇静 你我在不同世界里
说着彼此陌生言语
But I love the way she's talking to me
(Talking to me) I can hear it callin'
将不安融化
释放你心里的密码
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up 夜晚当孤单喧哗
戍守你的梦不倾塌
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up 让过去消失在眼底 (To the max)
此刻就让彼此是唯一 (Back back back it)
你张开双臂让我翱翔天际 Wow
我带你穿梭时空旅行 Git git git 言语似乎显得多余
(Whoa bout that action)
不如诚实相信身体
你心跳频率在向我回应
我听见你渐渐抛开压抑怀疑 你我在不同世界里
说着彼此陌生言语
But I love the way
She's talking to me (Talking to me) I can hear it callin'

在你梦的颜色里
是否投下我的名
把想念写在你的表情 Ooh tell me babe
在你爱的小说里
是否留下我的影
把忧郁变成你的美丽 Girl 当你想起
我注视你的眼睛 Ooh ooh
像写给自己的信 Ooh
终于有人读懂你
像在耳边的细语
永远温暖包围你 Yeah 欲言又止的乐曲 (Make it fast right)
是地图上未知的领域 (Put it on the map)
我们用人们不懂
的言语 Running laps
I just 纪录永不遗忘的笔记 让我们用身体翻译
无法解释的感觉和神秘
一起相信
Calling me up calling me
Yours calling my line

回忆也不会凋零 I can hear it callin'

Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up Callin'
Something in the way you wanna talk Your secrets  Always quiet
Hiding attractiveness
Waiting to be activated
Without warning
Like two silent meteors It's a miracle  Spanning what people
Cannot imagine as a distance
And you seem to still hesitate
Scared of rushing Would it hurt you(r)
Protected heart (Catch a flight)
But the signals your body subtle transmits  Yeah
Have long since accidentally betrayed you Call the longing spirit  Ey
Borrow a bit of bravery from the moonlight  Ey
The shadows trembling by (your) lips
Seem full of curiosity but feign calm You and I are in different worlds
Speaking languages unfamiliar to each other
But I love the way she's talking to me
(Talking to me) I can hear it callin'
Melt unease
Release the code in your heart
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up At night, when loneliness riots
Guard your dream not to collapse
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up Let the past disappear in the bottoms of (your) eyes (To the max)
Right now, let each other become the only ones (Back back back it)
You open your arms and let me soar in the sky  Wow
I take you through space travel  Git git git Words seem to look extra
(Whoa bout that action)
Better to honestly believe your body
Your heart rate is responding to me
I hear you gradually abandon repression and suspicion You and I are in different worlds
Speaking languages unfamiliar to each other
But I love the way
She's talking to me (Talking to me) I can hear it callin'
Melt unease
Release the code in your heart

Touch me tease me feel me up Ooh tell me babe
In the colors of your dreams
Is my name casted
Writing yearning in your expression Ooh tell me babe
In your romance novel
Is my shadow left
Turning sadness into your beauty Girl  When you remember
I watch your eyes  Ooh ooh
Like a letter written to myself/yourself  Ooh
Finally, someone has understood you
Like light words by the ear
Eternal warmth surrounds you  Yeah Hesitant song (Make it fast right)
Is an unknown region on the map (Put it on the map)
We use a language
People cannot understand  Running laps
I just  Record never forgotten notes Let us use our bodies to translate
Inexplicable feelings and mysteriousness
Believe together
Calling me up calling me
Yours calling my line
When time leaves
Memories will not wilt I can hear it callin'
Melt unease
Release the code in your heart
(Love the way you talk)
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up At night, when loneliness riots (Don't be late)
Guard your dream not to collapse
Touch me tease me feel me up

In the colors of your dreams

女王的新衣耀眼的星星
时尚的精英搭配什么看我的心情
你可以亲吻我的戒指
但不能碰我皇冠

Put on [my] gold chain, J's on my feet
The jealous ones can only troll me online
New Queen on the scene
Make way [for me] at once
I've never paid attention to the obstacles they've set
Changing my clothes back and forth, the choices already giving me a headache
Get in a good mood, accelerate1
The Queen's new get-up, shining stars
Elite de la mode, mix-and-match according to my mood
You may kiss my ring
But may not touch my crown
In a day I'm only
In a rush when I dress myself up
Put my new clothes on
Hoping for a different surprise every day Put my new clothes on
[I] Never brush off the efforts in dressing myself up
Get my swag on2
Hoping for a different surprise every day
Put my new clothes on
[I] Never brush off the efforts in dressing myself up
[Chinese opera:]
Wake up in the early morning, look in the mirror
What perfume to comb [my] hair with?
What powder to brush onto my cheeks?
What rouge to dab on [my] lips? [Ty:]
Many brands, luckily no need to care too much
Wear whatever I want to
Whatever brand
I make the clothes
[For others] the clothes make them
I'm all designer labels
[Others] They're all stupid3
My net worth is a bit high
And it keeps going up
Go out into the street like a thousand imported cars racing
Me coming from Chengdu4
Is a godsend to Chengdu
You're not only listening to music but also realness
Girls see me and get so happy like it's their birthday
Little bros' idolise me
[They] dig my honesty
And the big bros, sisters, uncles, aunties are all my fans
[If you're] not feeling it
Then get rid of your peasant-ness first5 Put my new clothes on
[I] Never brush off the efforts of dressing myself up
Get my swag on
Hoping for a different surprise every day Look at me, not worried about my makeup running
Spray the perfume I like
Or not it's impossible [for me] to go out
Whatever girls that don't love beauty
Or fashion, I'll kill them all
The bad boy[s] that you love
All want to get with me
So many haters see me as a thorn in their side6
When jealousy climbs out from your heart to the whole of your face
""Being yourself"" means ""being the trendiest newbie""
Dress up before leaving
Got to keep it up
When I appear, everyone's shocked
[If you] hate superficialness then pick your bias back up first
Near, far, draw lots7, make a wish
Got to be even cooler, fresher every day Get my swag on
Hoping for a different surprise every day
Put my new clothes on
[I] Never brush off the efforts in dressing myself up
Get my swag on
Hoping for a different surprise every day
Put my new clothes on
[I] Never brush off the efforts in dressing myself up [Chinese opera:]
Wake up in the early morning, look in the mirror
What perfume to comb [my] hair with?
What powder to brush onto [my] cheeks?
What rouge to dab on [my] lips?
Get my swag on
Hoping for a different surprise every day

We're all made of shooting stars We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love
We are made to love The scattered crayons, the fragmented, blank world
Remains there
Then I would
Oh yes I would
Doodle the bridge between reality and memories
Then I would
Trust me I would Pushing beyond the limits
Experience change in myself
These footprints have become the spotlight That we've got one life one world
So let's come together
We'll weather the storm
A rain of colors Look up to the sky
We're all made of shooting stars We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love
We are made to love Life is unimaginably small
Living cannot be forgone easily
Striving to become my truest self, oh yeah~
Tomorrow, be it rain or shine
Let us give love more meaning
The world charging forward with love, oh~ Cause we’ve got one life one world
So let’s come together
We’ll weather the storm
A rain of colors Look up to the sky
We’re all made of shooting stars We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love WOO OH~
We are made to love
We are made to love
We are made to love ",Raenlyn,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/raenlyn

我喜欢阅读她微醺时的眼眸
而我的咖啡
糖不用太多
这世界已经因为她甜得过头 没有跟她笑容一样浓郁的雪茄
就别浪费时间介绍收起来吧
拱廊的壁画
旧城的涂鸦
所有色彩都因为她说不出话 这爱不落幕
忘了心事的国度
你所在之处
孤单都被征服 铁铸的招牌
错落着就像
一封封城市
献给天空的情书
当街灯亮起 Havana 漫步
这是世上最美丽的那双人舞 缤纷的老爷车跟着棕榈摇曳
载着海风私奔漫无目的
古董书摊漫着时光香气
我想上辈子是不是就遇过你
喧嚣的海报躺在
慵懒的阁楼阳台
而你是文学家笔下的那一片海 麻烦给我的爱人来一杯 Mojito
我喜欢阅读她微醺时的眼眸
而我的咖啡
糖不用太多
这世界已经因为她甜得过头 这爱不落幕
忘了心事的国度

I like reading her eyes when she's slightly drunk
And don't put too much
Sugar in my coffee
Coz' the world is oversweet for her If you don't have the cigar so mellow as her smile
Don't waste time for introduction
Murals of arcades
Graffiti in the old town
All colors have become mute for her The love will be never over
In the country free from worry
Wherever you are
Even solitude is conquered Iron signboards
Set up at random
Like love letters
From the city to the sky
As street lights are on, strolling in Havana
It's the most beautiful pas de deux of the world Iridescent classic cars swing with palms
Loading sea breezes, eloping aimlessly
Old book stalls giving off the fragrance of time
I wonder whether we've met in another life
Noisy posters lie on
The loft terrace in lethargy
As you're the sea in the litterateur's writing Please give my lover a glass of mojito
I like reading her eyes when she's slightly drunk
And don't put too much
Sugar in my coffee
Coz' the world is oversweet for her The love will be never over
In the country free from worry
Wherever you are
Even solitude is conquered Iron signboards
Set up at random

And similar clouds float across the sky.
If in your next life you could trust the sea
Like the sea talking to fish.
The story broke off after two or three sentences.
Maybe events don't happen the way you want.
And now love is hopeless.
How should I portray your appearance? The first snow whirls in the frosty wind.
Can you give me another chance to start all over again?
Now he is intoxicated by the smile of a beautiful woman,
As if he had just woken up from a dream and forgot everything. The rain fell sadly.
During the rain, this night moon is flawless.
I raise the brush and carve two or three strokes
Just portray your appearance. You told me you just wanna live a simple life.
So I said I thought about the future.
My life without you is so downhearted.
I also realized that sometimes I play with fire. Oh nah! I know what you think about it.
Oh nah! I just want you to know.
Nahnah! You can always count on me.
I can't bear to see you suffer.
So I began to pretend not to think of you.
Better I’ll escape completely powerless.
I never wanted to part with you. I miss you.
I want to let go of everything and start all over again. I love you.
I really lost everything and can’t bring you back? The first snow whirls in the frosty wind.
Can you give me another chance to start all over again?
Now he is intoxicated by the smile of a beautiful woman,

Just portray your appearance. I don't wanna lose my fate vainly. It's like I'm doomed to miss you.
My world is quickly fall apart. Oh, it's so short-lived.
Therefore, so many words. However, I'm helpless.
The result has long been known:
You just wanna leave me, ye. Tell me to leave you alone and that you're regret. But I...
Can you give me a chance? But you
Make me hysterical. I feel like I'm heartbroken, oh wu.
You are gone, and my world has fallen into the abyss.
I no longer have a sense of time.
And I haven't had time to say goodbye.
I always feel that I should apologize to you for the last time.
Aw nah ye But after that, she is no longer by my side, ye.
Are you scared without me?
Nahnah yeye Is it possible to return to former youth? The first snow whirls in the frosty wind.
Can you give me another chance to start all over again?
Now he is intoxicated by the smile of a beautiful woman,
As if he had just woken up from a dream and forgot everything. I don't wanna talk. I don't wanna hide anything.
I never wanna get out of your world.

片片芳菲 入水流 涼涼天意 潋滟一身花色
落入凡塵 傷情著我
生劫易渡 情劫難了
折舊的心 還有幾分前生的恨 涼涼三生三世 恍然如夢
須臾的年 風乾淚痕
若是回憶 不能再相認
就讓情分 落九塵 涼涼十里 何時還會春盛
又見樹下 一盞風存
落花有意 流水無情
別讓恩怨愛恨 涼透那花的純

After, in my tears I finally understand
Some people, you miss the chance and they're gone White Gardenia petals
Fall on to my blue pleated skirt

I lowered my head and took in the fragrance I was seventeen
On that everlasting night
That you kissed me
From that moment, every time I sigh
It makes me think back
To the starlight that night How is it that love back then
Was this simple?
And why is it,
That in our youth
We must hurt those we love deeply
On this similarly deep night
Do you also quietly wonder in remorse,
If we weren't so stubborn back then
Would we not have so much regret now? How do you remember me,
With a smile or a silently?
These last few years,
Has there been anyone who stops you feeling lonely? After I've finally learned how to love
What a pity you have long disappeared in the crowd
After, in my tears I finally understand
Some people, you miss the chance and they're gone How do you remember me,
With a smile or silently?

Holding hands, do not be afraid, not caring about tomorrow

Holding hands, do not be afraid, not caring about tomorrow
Who is afraid of the wandering destiny? Holding hands and not letting go, to love and to never forget
How majestic does life need to be?
Vanity always ends with nothing; those that are persistent will follow the wind
How many ups and downs do the road of love need? How many rocky waves to make the heart stop swaying?
Together reminiscing the past
Waiting with you. The wind stopped, the fog dissipated. The rain still, the snow melted.

星星孤單單墜落在那片海
是你打撈起我們
把每滴壞的眼淚 擦乾 我要的愛 只在你身上存在
要不是你 不會哭得笑得傻得 像小孩
在一起 不簡單 別輕易 說分開
你給的愛 都變成我的依賴
依賴著你的我 可以盡情不勇敢
因為你 我相信 愛存在 就算能刪除記憶
就算能複制情感
誰都無法控制愛
一旦決定愛你 我不管 我不換
你就是 任誰都 無法 替代
Yeah~ 我的最愛 只在你身上存在
只有你在 極光才有力量變得更絢爛
只有你 能幸福 我回憶 到未來 你給的愛 都變成我的依賴
依賴著你的我
可以盡情不勇敢 因為你 我相信 愛存在
In your eyes In your eyes In my life

It makes the roses fall every time it blooms
We have always been eager to fight, to hug, and to fall in love
I miss you every moment that I’ve been alone
For your love is the one that I adore and it constitutes the every beat of my heart The love that I want is to only exist by your side
If it’s not for you, I will not cry, I will not smile, and I will not act innocently like a child
I know it’s not easy for us to stay together but please don’t easily say goodbye
This kind of love that you give me becomes the dependence of my life
I depend on you and I can’t be brave alone without you Because of you, I believe that love really does exist
In your eyes in your eyes in my life
I understand and I desire the existence of your love If loving you is the most intense place of adventure
I believe at the end of this quest is a pocketful of warmth
Those lonely stars that fall on the sea
You picked them up for both of us
So that it wipe away these dreadful tears from our eyes The love that I want is to only exist by your side
If it’s not for you, I will not cry, I will not smile, and I will not act innocently like a child
I know it’s not easy for us to stay together but please don’t easily say goodbye
This kind of love that you give me becomes the dependence of my life
I depend on you and I can’t be brave alone without you
Because of you, I believe that love really does exist Even if our memories could be erased in our mind
Even if someone could imitate your affections
No one could ever control me for who I should love
From the moment I decided to love you I will not mind them and I will not change my mind
You’re the only one in my heart who can never be replaced
Yeah My favorite kind of love is to exist only by your side
As long as you’re here, the polar lights dazzle more magnificently
Only you could make my happily anticipate the future This kind of love that you give me becomes the dependence of my life
I depend on you
and I can’t be brave alone without you Because of you, I believe that love really does exist
In your eyes in your eyes in my life
I understand and I desire the existence of your love ",Aquestra,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/aquestra

Staying up late to work, unable to sleep?
I wait for you to fulfill your dream,
So that you'll stop pushing yourself so hard.
It's my fault,
My pride was too high, I didn't take good care of you.
Pride is fragile,
And my greatest fear was that you didn't want my heart. Can you still cry to me, smile with me, be nice to me?
Still make me think of you, be crazy about you, grow old with you?
How have you been? I really want to know,
Don't rush to throw the memories away. I just need you to be with me, to argue with me, to get in trouble with me,
Let the good me replace the bad me,
I need to hear you say that you really love me,
But I can't go back to that moment,
How have you been? Heaven knows I can't take it anymore,
Regret is drilling into my heart and burning,
Even embracing you just one more time would be fine,
Whatever you want, I would do it. Can you still cry to me, smile with me, be nice to me?
Still let me think of you, be crazy about you, grow old with you?
All the good I gave to you, do you still want it?
Yet I dare not hear the answer, I just need you to be with me, to argue with me, to get in trouble with me,
Don't use leaving me to teach me the lesson of losing someone important,
Don't say you used to love me,
Let us go back to that one moment,
How have you been? Can you still cry to me, smile with me, be nice to me?
Still let me think of you, be crazy about you, grow old with you?

I'm ignoring your murmurs, which have an invisible force over me Your voice is meaningless to me
And even if I heard- and I haven't- it's just anxiety
Everyone I love is here
Please, mysterious voice, I don't want anything to do with you
I've been through too much, I can't take risks anymore
I'm afraid to follow you, I don't think I can bear the consequences Go seek the truth
The mysterious truth
The unknown truth What do you want? Every night you bother me
If you disturb me, maybe I'll make a mistake carelessly
Maybe someone's calling me, because we are really similar
In my heart it's clear, I don't belong here Every day my powers are growing, but I don't want it this way
There's a hope calling me from the distance Go seek the truth

The unknown truth Where are you?
Whether or not
I can feel you
Give me a sign Where do you want to go? Don't abandon me!
How can I follow you

Only lowering your head in silence
Should I believe that you love me so
Unwilling to patronise me
Or should I understand this as you no longer wanting to save what we have I want to ask why
I’m no longer your happiness
But why did I smile bitterly and say that I already understand
Pride often drags people along
Making love tortuous
Pretending to understand is due to the fear of the naked truth
Being embarrassed feels worse than losing you What I miss is being able to talk about everything
What I miss is dreaming together　
What I miss is that after our fights
I still have the urge to love you I remember the birthday that year
I remember that song too
I remember that starry night sky
How tight your right hand held my left
The warmth of your chest
Who remembers?
Who has forgotten? What I miss is being moved beyond words
What I miss is our absolute passion
What I miss is how agitated you were
Begging me for forgiveness, hugging me till it hurts　
I remember you behind me
I also remember me trembling
Remember that flood of feelings
The most beautiful fireworks
The longest embrace Who loved with too much freedom
Who walked away too far
Who took my heart
Who forgot that was a promise
Who self-centeredly walked away
Who forgot to look after me
Who let love turn heavy
Who forgot to give you tenderness I still have the urge to love you
I remember the birthday that year
I remember that song too
I remember that starry night sky
How tightly your right hand held my left
The warmth of your chest
I let go　
I gave up my place
Pretending to be relaxed
Who will understand how unwilling I am to part (with you)
I loved too much
Therefore I didn’t cry

本是 秋意 正浓 ","Autumn rain hitting the lanterns
Lotus petals filled the Pier
The young man was having a good dream on the river Startled by the sudden sea of flames
Blood flooded the lotus pods on the boat
I was unharmed in the flames, but all was lost Waves surging, thunder roaring
Sandu brandishing, Zidian swinging
Watching from the high ground, the happenings of the world seemed even more complex Even a thousand people of the mortal world cannot be of greater importance than me
After this, I would have to send away even more dead bodies It's hard to let everything that happened be gone with the wind
Under the drunken sunlight, miles of land was tinted red
Far over the mountains and across the rivers
Would there be still someone waiting at Lotus Pier? In my dreams, I returned numerous times to my childhood at the courtyard Who was hugging the cold sword with the icy blade all along?
All that's left was the sea of blood and a lone lamp Blood splashed on the lanterns by the door
The bland tea in the cup had already gone cold
That person from the past was startled awake from his dream Pointing my sword at my old friend
I realized we were seeking different paths
The bond that we shared back then was unlike that with other friends Under the sound of heavy downpour
I was shocked by the truth of the golden core
How could I hate that person from the past? When we parted our ways
Who disappeared and left no trace like a flying dandelion on a green mountain?
When we met again, my friend was vaguely recognizable behind a new appearance Should I hate that everything I had from my past were all gone with the wind?
The sky and earth were stained red by blood
When my old friend bid his farewell, I had words to say but couldn't utter them Like a silkworm, I was enmeshed in a web of my own spinning
He died with regrets of not being able to explain himself
I could only let the cold ash fly away with no avail Coming and going in haste like morning dew
And like the wind that blows for a thousand miles in the vast heaven
Our gatherings and partings in this lifetime seem just like a dream Zidian has no emotions so how can it sense my pain?
I cannot point the cold blade of Sandu at him again

不还手 不放手
笔下画不完的圆

Taking an afternoon nap,cicada noise comes from the playground.
After many years, it still sounds good. Fold up the dreams into a paper airplane and send it as a letter.
Because we can't wait for that meteor.
I seriously throw the coin that decides fate.
Yet I don't know where I can go. A promise we made when growing up together.
It's so clear.
I believe it since we made a pinky swear.
We said we would go on holiday together.
Nowadays it's your only wilful persistence. In the corridor we stand as punishment and have our hands
slapped.
Yet we pay attention to the dragonfly by the window.
Wherever I go you follow very closely.

Do it proof it,do it proof it,do it proof it ","I could uproot mountains with my strength, and my spirit could devour the world I desire the realisation of the raging fire within my heart
Let time decide the victor and the vanquished between the two of us
Look at how winners and losers endlessly alternate throughout history
Weaklings are always competing to see
who runs the fastest  Follow me, let us set out to battle against the enemy on every side
We are undefeated, we shall maintain our dignity
Follow me, break through all your limits I am indebted to you for taking care of me
You stood by my side to encourage and support me  Now watch me raise a toast and enjoy the wine alone  Go into the distance, and let me finish this task to clear my mind
I once wondered wistfully what would have been if Jing Ke hadn't tried to assassinate the King of Qin
Looking at these four walls, this height is too greedy  Once more, using the tone I'm familiar with
Don't ruin this; reality is but a projection of our inner desires
Win or lose, we'll be talked about through the passage of time
This plight of being besieged by the songs of Chu from all directions
No matter what your thoughts on this are Once more, using the tone I'm familiar with
This time bring out the resolve to win
You must have faith in this game of compatibility
Why be afraid of the songs of Chu from all directions
Even in an ambush on all sides, you have your own voice I could uproot mountains with my strength, and my spirit could devour the world
But this era does not favour me, and my steed can no longer run, no longer run, no longer run
What can I do, what can I do, if my steed won't run?
My wife, my wife, what will happen to you?
What will you have of me?

将头发梳成大人模样
穿上一身帅气西装

回到教室座位前后故意讨妳温柔的骂
黑板上排列组合　妳舍得解开吗
谁与谁坐他又爱着她 那些年错过的大雨

We have finally arrived at this day
The old photograph under the table mat
Links together numerous old memories
Today the boy and girl will go on their final date We have returned once again to the start
Standing blankly in front of the mirror
Clumsily fastening the red tie's knot
I'll brush my hair into the style of an adult
And wear a handsome-looking suit
In a bit, when I meet you, I'll be better looking than you expected Oh, how I wish we could return to those times
Return to our seats in the classroom, deliberately trying to get you to gently scold me
The combinations on the blackboard, are you willing to solve them?
Regardless of the seating, he will always love her The heavy rains we missed in those years
The young love we missed in those years

I used to want to take on the world
But in the end I realized
You are my whole world The heavy rains we missed in those years

The promise in a parallel universe

I never choose to give up my dream
even in my darkest days Maybe I am not the talent
but I have the pure dream
I will spent my whole life proving it
Maybe I am not the hand of the diligent
but I would keep exploring
to stake my youth without any regrets To run forward against the cold shoulders and the jeering crowds
if we didn't go through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, how can we feel this wonderful life
The destiny can't let us down on my knees
even we have paid in blood embrace To keep running with the pride of childlike simplicity
if we didn't persist to the end, how can we see the glory of the life
Better to light up a life than accept a life we don't want
One day it will be reborn The charming future always says hello to me
even suffering is my only companion, I will keep moving
I wanna sail on the bluest ocean
no matter whether I will come back or not I am lonely when I will fail
that's the sign of the coward
As long as I am alive, please clench our fists
before the daybreak
we are even more brave
to wait for the most dazzling moments during the sunrise To run forward against the cold shoulders and the jeering crowds
if we didn't go through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, how can we feel this wonderful life
The destiny can't let us down on my knees
even we have paid in blood embrace To keep running with the pride of the people

我忍住的情绪在很后面
拼命想往回的从前
在我脸上依旧清晰可见 最美的不是下雨天
是曾与你躲过雨的屋檐
回忆的画面
在荡着秋千 梦开始不甜 你说把爱渐渐放下会走更远
又何必去改变已错过的时间
你用你的指尖 阻止我说再见
想像你在身边在完全失去之前 你说把爱渐渐放下会走更远
或许命运的签只让我们遇见
只让我们相恋这一季的秋天
飘落后才发现这幸福的碎片
要我怎么捡？ ","The cold coffee leaves the coaster
My restrained feelings have been left far behind
Desperately wishing we could return to the past
And on my face you can see it clearly, as always The most beautiful moments were not the rainy days
They were the times we sheltered from the rain beneath the eaves
The picture of our memories
The dreams begin to sour as we sit on the swings You say if we let love go gradually, we'll go further
For how are we to change the times when they've passed?
You stopped my goodbyes with your fingertip
I imagine the times before you completely disappeared from my side You say if we let love go gradually, we'll go further
Maybe destiny would have us but meet
And let us love for this single autumn
Only after the fall, I realise:
How do I pick up these broken pieces of happiness? ",weiling.tay,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/weilingtay

In the shallows where you left your footprints.

Killing me softly.
My heart is broken by the rain of love.
The wind penetrates my body.
Feel it under the skin.

Doubts in your soul
That pushes me to the edge of the cliff
And plunges me into deep anxiety without end, yeah! I want you to have chaotic breathing too.
Stop calmly watching me get into character.
The way you look back is like an elegant blade that
Softly killing me. I can feel it in my bones. Unfair love

在此我想给我的母亲最真诚的致谢
为了把我养大放弃了她的事业
可是我却让她痛苦在每个日夜 外婆她告诉我我的父亲早已死去
当时的情景我还记得房间一片死寂
此情此景我已经不想再去回忆
还有我那些素未蒙面哥哥姐姐弟弟 Back to school 我不 听话
让老师同学害怕
他们互相说悄悄话
我把罪恶都犯下
这画面一霎那乍现
像一只大雁
我怕见到曾犯下错的那面 把戾气带进学校
逃学我找到诀窍
警察把我找到妈妈哭着说我还年少
那时我觉得所有人都跟我作对
我在我自己的世界尽情的落坠 离家出走的我那时还是未满15
我打架跷课成为了全家人的耻辱
我讨厌约束 讨厌被禁锢
用最极端的方法
让伤害过我的人记住 你是否有时觉得 命运它对你不公
但有时又会学着 在沉重里找轻松
我仰望星空 把过去冰封
我发誓绝不会

Everyday 有多少问题要去面对
有多少夜 痛苦烦恼着你无法入睡 谁都一样 会生老病死

树叶在流浪 风还没静止
你我都一样想永远名留青史
从小我就知道脚要踩地天在头顶
佛在上方俯瞰众生就像蝼蚁 不用害怕 黑暗战胜不了光
你保持真实就会得到爱的表彰
我想要什么
我会通过努力独立去争
不是像个孩子在我身后狂喷
想要梦想的路永远亮着绿灯
就算是跪着也要朝着目标狂奔 我才不管你有什么看法
当我需要精神救赎你又在哪
太多必要交际 在不停交替着
提醒我这虚伪面具下的脸都太假 梦中小路我不会停下脚步
都想成功可成功毕竟占少数
我慢慢从横冲 直撞到变牢固
我在肮脏的泥泞里面找宝物 没经历苦难怎么叫做生活
每一次分叉口我都仔细斟酌
现在我站在这里 太阳它照常升起
不管遇到什么笑着面对才是真理 Life’s a struggle

Here I want to give my most sincere appreciation to my mother
Giving up her career for raising me
But I made her painful,at every day and night Grandmother told me that my father had already passed away
For the moment,for the scene,I still remember the room to be silent like death
I already don't want to recall this scene and this feeling
Including those brothers and sisters whom I have never seen Back to school,I wasn't
Making classmates and teachers terrified
They whispered to each other
I have done all the commitedness in the world
The picture came to my mind in a blink of an eye
Like a wild goose
I am scared to see the faults I've ever had I brought the evil to the school
I found the key to run away from school
When the policeman found me,mom cried that I was still too young
I felt like everyone were against me at that time
I fell and fell in my own world I wasn't up to 15 when left home
I brought the whole family only shame,for me fighting and absenting
I hated a rope to bind me,or a cage to lock me in
I used the most extreme way
To make an impression to the hearts of people who have hurt me Do you think sometimes,the fate isn't fair to you
But sometimes you learn to,look for lightness in the calm
I look up into the sky,and freeze up my past
I swear I will never
Be as ordinary and common as them Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day
How many nights and how much pains haunt you,making you sleepless Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day
How many nights and how much pains haunt you,making you sleepless Everyone's the same,common to see one ill and die
The truth is forgot,hidden in the letter paper
The leaves are wanderin',the wind hasn't stopped
You and I,we're all the same,wanna be in history forever
I knew from childhood,the feet is upon the ground,the head is underneathe the sky
The Budda is upon us,overlooking all the people as if they're only ants Don't be afraid,the dark can't beat the light
As long as you keep real,and you'll get the praise of love
For what I want
I would try hard and get it by myself
Not like a child,shouting out loud behind me,
""There are always green lights on road of dream!""
I gotta run the most crazily to the goal,even if I run by my knees I don't care about what you think
Where are you when I need you to save my mind?
Too much necessary relationships,are taking each other's place every time
Reminding me that,all the faces behind this false mask are too faked I wouldn't stop my steps on my path in my dreams
All want to succeed while success is only a small part of all
I gradually become firm from rushing here and there
I look for treasures in the dirty mud How can life be itself by the time you experience the pain?
I thought carefully at every crossing
Now I am standing here,and the sun rises as usual
No matter what you meet,the right thing to do is smiling at it Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day
How many nights and how much pains haunt you,making you sleepless Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day
How many nights and how much pains haunt you,making you sleepless Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day
How many nights and how much pains haunt you,making you sleepless Life's a struggle
You still have to make your way through life
There are still a zillion trouble after you taste all the happinesses,anger,sorrows and joy
How many problems you're gonna face every day

When I was having hard time being lonely
The unfamiliar atmosphere
The fearful thrills

You make it natural for me to be here When we shine bright

Under this light, when we look at each other
Even not noticing myself, I smile and I forget yeah
Cuz I’m not alone
You are my warming home

From the first snow until the midnight summer
When I see you in the eyes and hold you in my arms
I can get away from my loneliness You and I can connect anytime
I’ll respond to you
I found the place where I can feel comfortable
My home my own
When I look at myself in the mirror
I feel my smile is always the same Once again we can be strong

dark circles under the eyes are still left by tiredness*
the world of emotions
cannot avoid having hurt present
no matter how beautiful nightfall is, it must give way to the dark night CHORUS still remember the ""goodbye"" coming out of your mouth with iron determination
in the dimness, there was an illusion of being scorched by the sun
the horizon of nightfall
traced the words of leaving

Far-off dreams fading into mist
Your image has been dissipated by the wind Wilted chrysanthemums are spread across the floor; even your smile has turned faintly yellow
The falling flowers induce sadness, and my thoughts languish
In the passing of the north wind and the dusk, your shadow lingers on
And standing by the lake, I only have my own reflection for company Responding to the dusk, the flowers shed their brilliant shine
They wilter on life's path, meeting a tragic fate
Don't cross the river in melancholy
You may spend a lifetime drifting, never reaching the shore Whose empire is it now? The sound of horse hoofs thunders in the distance.
My resplendent armour decays with the hounds of time
Your soft sigh heralds the first ray of dawn
The conclusion to another restless night Wilted chrysanthemums are spread across the floor; even your smile has turned faintly yellow
The falling flowers induce sadness, and my thoughts languish

Since we couldn`t hold forever
When we said goodbye
Why not share happiness with tears? Ten years ago
We didn`t even know each other at all
We were all the same, stayed by a stranger`s side
Walking through the familiar street
Ten years later
We`re still friends and greet each other

Swerve away a few passes /Radiating dominance
The picador charges in to rythme of the beat
MER
Follow us, MER
The back is pierced and veins burst open
The enraged bull is ferocious as a demon
The banderillero plants in the banderillas
MER
Follow us, MER Repeat the Verónica Wildness bares the purity of the soul or its recklessness
After they nurtured the original sin
Their hands now seek to destroy it Wildness bares the purity of the soul or its recklessness
After they nurtured the original sin
Their hands now seek to destroy it Wildness bares the purity of the soul or its recklessness
After they nurtured the original sin
Their hands now seek to destroy it Watch closely, men are scattering under the magnifying glass
Nature and humankind are not in balance / Prejudice makes the decisions
Dangers set in the future  for every splash of hot blood here
Nerves tingle as anticipated after that electrifying moment / Satisfaction only found in the blood boiling within
Dream-like illusions build the palace of art
Where beauty and cruelty merge as one / There lies a norm inseparable from taste in art
If swapped / None can enter the swirling mind of an artist
There is only half a chance to tame the bold and powerful
To gauge-- how piercing our screams are
How risky the bearable level of decibels is in this man-made world
Like an electric shock -- a reverberation of dopamine secretion
Placed in every single detail
Hailed by millions / Life hanging by a thread
Too chaotic / Life is meant to cycle
Praying for the devil's demise / Imagining serenity and calm
Following our kind nature -- the last pride and chance  for the victory of mankind ",Hua Fansubs Hua,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/hua-fansubs-hua

You didn't mean from your heart

The crazier I'll be in love with you I'd come to an understanding all of a sudden
That what you've said would never come true
As I took another look at your face
It was so indifferent and would never be like before My world began to snow
So cold that I couldn't love for one more day
So cold that I could no longer hide my regretfulness I kissed you goodbye on that empty street
Let the wind laugh at me and I couldn't reject that
I kissed you goodbye in that perplexing night

Is like a kite cut off of its thread
It can't fly into your world
Or warm your sight I'm seeing that
A tragedy show is going on
There's no joy at the end
While I'm still hiding in your dreams I'd come to an understanding all of a sudden
That what you've said would never come true

Regretting for not reaching
Still scared even after we've embraced
So I pushed you away
While I remain At that moment came a ray of light
Piercing my eyes
Your gaze was of understanding
Why couldn't you just turn away
I stood against the light, and there I saw The light came from your tears glistening
I don't wish to resist that power anymore
Finally I come face-to-face with hope, and against the light
I now feel where love exists
It has always been right beside me I thought I could retreat my steps
Proving again and again
How wrong our love was
Everything was dark when my back was turned against you
Holding back my fatigue
I pried my eyes and the windows open

Your beauty scatters into a wisp,
Going to a place I can't go. The azure colour is waiting for the misty rain
And I'm waiting for you

Separated by the river millions of miles apart
On the base of the vase is inscribed with Hanshu1 imitating the grace of the former dynasty.
Just pretend I am foreshadowing my meeting with you. The azure colour is waiting for the misty rain
And I'm waiting for you
The moonlight is fished up
Blurring the ending
As if the Chinese flower pot that is passed on from generation to generation,caring only about it's own beauty.
Your eyes carry a smile. The white and flower blue Koi fish has already jumped into the bottom of the bowl.
Yet when I copy the Song typeface of the signature I'm missing you.
You are hidden in the kiln,1000 year old secret.
Extremely exquisite like a embroidery needle falling to the ground. Outside the curtain, the banana tree draws showers of rain of it
The door knocker incurs copper rust
And I pass by that small town by the River South and attract you
In the splash-ink landscape painting
You are hidden away deep in the ink colour The azure colour is waiting for the misty rain
And I'm waiting for you

Separated by the river millions of miles apart

我怕时间太慢
日夜担心失去你
恨不得一夜之间白头
永不分离 如果全世界我也可以放弃
至少还有你值得我去珍惜
而你在这里
就是生命的奇迹
也许全世界我也可以忘记
就是不愿意失去你的消息
你掌心的痣
我总记得在那里
在那里 ","I'm afraid that I'm late, let me hold you tight.
Till I feel your wrinkles
with the traces of aging.
Till I'm sure that I'm not dreaming.
Till I lose my energy.
For you, I'm willing to do everything. Even if I can’t move anymore, I'll still keep you in sight.
Till I feel your hairline
with the traces of turning grey and even white.
Till my eyesight becomes blurry.
Even if till I no longer breathe.
Let's be inseparable all the time. If the whole world I could give up,
at least I still have you who deserve to cherish.
And you are here
that it's a miracle of my life.
Maybe the whole world I could even forget,
but I don’t want to be left out of your life.
The mark on your palm
I always remember where it is. I'm afraid that I'm late, let me hold you tight.
Till I feel your hairline
with the traces of turning grey and even white.
Till my eyesight becomes blurry.
Even if till I no longer breathe.
Let's be inseparable all the time. If the whole world I could give up,
at least I still have you who deserve to cherish.
And you are here
that it's a miracle of my life.
Maybe the whole world I could even forget,
but I don’t want to be left out of your life.
Even the mark on your palm
I always remember where it is. The life is never easy for us.
We cannot deny our destiny.
I'm afraid that time goes too fast,
I don't enough time to look at you carefully.
I'm afraid that time goes too slow,
Day and night I'm worry about losing you.
I couldn't wait that our hair turns white overnight.
Then we'll never be apart. If the whole world I could give up,
at least I still have you who deserve to cherish.
And you are here
that it's a miracle of my life.
Maybe the whole world I could even forget,
but I don’t want to be left out of your life.
The mark on your palm
I always remember where it is,
just over there... ",Joyce Su,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/joyce-su

我想带你会  我的外婆家一起
看着日落  一直到我们都睡觉 我想就这样牵着你的手不放开
爱能不能够永远单纯煤没有悲哀
我想带你骑单车
我想跟你看棒球
想这样没担忧唱着歌一直走 我想就这样牵着你的手不放开
爱可不可以永远单纯没有受害

你在我胸口睡着

As if loving someone makes everything worth doing

Holding your hand is an indescribable experience
I want to go together to my (maternal) grandmother's house
To watch the sunset until we both fall asleep I want to be like this, holding your hand and never letting go
Can love have enough eternal innocence without grief
I want to ride bicycles with you
I want to watch baseball with you
Like this never worrying  singing as we walk I want to be like this, holding your hand and never letting you go
Could love be forever innocent and without grief
You resting on my shoulder
You falling asleep on my stomach

Everything is shining and magnificent.
My dear princess,
Have you ever encountered your dreams I'll open your eyes
To the most beautiful night in this world
Sitting on this magical carpet,
crossing the borders of our kingdom A whole new world,
I'll give you fantastic new experiences
Find your own direction
Use your faith to finally realize your dreams A whole new world,
A strange new light is in front of us.
As I soar through the sky accompanied by stars
My world has changed because of you,
I will meet you in this whole new world,
Unburdened by difficult or unexplainable feelings,
freely flying,
through shining crystals. A whole new world,
don't close your eyes,
gaze across the endless new world,
please hold your breath.
I'm like a shooting star streaking across the sky,
unable to ever go back to the mundane past A whole new world,
Every step is a new surprise,
As we look for new tracks at the horizon,
We'll remember every second,
Together we will witness the future and make memories
I only wish to share the world with you A whole new world
Soaring through the sky
Filled with adventure
In this world
With you and I ",seaside,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/seaside
