      <td>I want to know how long meteors can fly\nIf their beauty is worth seeking\nThe flowers of the night sky scatter behind you\nIt's made me happy for a while, and they are worth waiting for\nAnd so my heart runs wild, from dusk until dawn, unable to bear I am willing to fall into your hands\nEclosion* becomes the rainbow in the dark night\nMetamorphoses becomes the light breeze in the moonlight Happiness jumps into your river and keeps swimming until the end\nHappiness jumps into your river and keeps swimming until the end Happiness jumps into your river and keeps swimming until the end\nHappiness jumps into your river and keeps swimming until the end\nHappiness jumps into your river and keeps swimming until the end I want to know how long meteors can fly\nIf their beauty is worth  *Eclosion is the process a winged insect undergoes when it emerges from a cocoon and becomes its adult form. 羽化 can also mean, in Daoism, when one becomes light as a feather and ascends to heaven. In the context of the song, it likely means emerging from one's confines.</td>

How many times have we changed our beliefs?\nTo finally exchange wedding rings without looking back at the past. Pass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.\nReflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.\nEveryone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,\nRejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.\nWait for the sorrow to disappear and better days to come again.\nThe sunlight envelops, forgive all the letters that were written.\nHow much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? The candle brightens up the atmosphere but does not illuminate an answer. Love is not just a simple, heartwarming meal.\nScattering flower petals on the bed, embrace will nurture love.\nYet too much of love will cause it to bloom on another's soil. Love needs to be handled by not just one person, closing distances will create expectations, and expectations will bring disappointment - An endless vicious cycle.\nRomance is short lived, time will cause dissatisfaction.\nThe end of youth brings about a loyal partner.\nPass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.\nReflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.\nEveryone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,\nRejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.\nWait for the sorrow to disappear and better days to come again.\nThe sunlight envelops, forgive all the letters that were written.\nHow much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? Pass on the warmth from one to another's bosom.\nReflect on the mistakes of the past and dream anew.\nEveryone is the same, after having felt uncertainty and fear,\nRejects the idea of becoming a slave to love. Memories are like the moonlight that cannot be held onto, tightening one's grip results in darkness.\nWait for the sorrow to disappear and better days to come again.\nThe sunlight envelops, forgive all the letters that were written.\nHow much courage does it take to go towards forever when Love does not wait? Don't be disappointed, the trials for one's soul is to obtain the bliss of simplicity.﻿</td>
