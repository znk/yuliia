      <td>愛一旦結冰　一切都好平靜\n淚水它一旦流盡　只剩決心\n放逐自己在黑夜的邊境\n任由黎明一步一步向我逼近\n想你的心　化成灰燼 真的有點累了　沒什麼力氣\n有太多太多回憶　哽住呼吸\n愛你的心我無處投遞 如果可以飛簷走壁找到你\n愛的委屈　不必澄清\n只要你將我抱緊 如果雲知道　想你的夜慢慢熬\n每個思念過一秒　每次呼喊過一秒\n只覺得生命不停燃燒 如果雲知道　逃不開糾纏的牢\n每當心痛過一秒　每回哭醒過一秒\n只剩下心在乞討　你不會知道</td>
      <td>Once love is frozen, it's quiet all around.\nOnce tears run dry, only resolution remains.\nI banish myself to the edge of the dark night\nand make no struggle as the dawn is approaching me step by step.\nMy heart that's yearning for you has burned down into ashes. I really feel a bit tired now and I don't have any strength.\nToo many memories choke my breath.\nI have nowhere to send you my heart that's loving you. If I can fly over roofs and climb the walls to find you,\nit's not even necessary to clarify the wrong I feel in loving you.\nIt'll be just fine if you hold me tight. If only the clouds knew how I suffer during the long night when I miss you.\nFor one second I miss you, for another I yell out loud.\nI just feel that my life keeps burning. If only the clouds knew that I can't escape from this jail that's tangling up my mind.\nFor one second my heart aches, for another I wake up crying.\nThe only thing that remains is my begging heart, but you will never know.</td>

      <td>One stroke one soft sigh,one line one sadness.\nThe story is waiting for the ink to dry,yet the wait brought in heartache.\nSince then, fate was blurred out on paper.\nThese sheets of paper less three hundred years ago. Looking at how sharp and how many curves the brushstroke,many rounds of incarnation in previous lives.\nThe fate in the mortal world tangled through the clouds, intertwined through the ninth Heaven.\nHopelessly passing through, three lives were broken upon the rocks.\nThe chaos among men,no complaints through the late of nights.\nHated that the dream is too short. Broken upon ten miles,the pain of the peach blossoms,where did love drift and settle?\nI will blossom for you,the world’s most beautiful presence.\nBroken upon ten miles,the pain of the peach blossoms,lighting incense in front of the Gods for you.\nWishing to be a pair with you through three lifetimes. Looking at how sharp and how many curves the brushstroke,many rounds of incarnation in previous lives.\nThe fate in the mortal world tangled through the clouds, intertwined through the ninth Heaven.\nHopelessly passing through,three lives were broken upon the rocks.\nThe chaos among men,no complaints through the late of nights.\nHated that the dream is too short. Broken upon ten miles, the pain of the peach blossoms,where did love drift and settle?\nI will blossom for you,the world’s most beautiful presence.\nBroken upon ten miles,the pain of the peach blossoms,lighting incense in front of the Gods for you.\nWishing to be a pair with you through three lifetimes.\nTen miles love continuously followed the peach blossoms, drifting fragrance.</td>

      <td>A'Diao, she lives in some part of Tibet;\nShe's like a vulture, perching on Mountain tops.\nA'Diao, there's a flood of sunlight before the gates of *Jokhang Temple;\nWe make a pot of sweet tea and talk about our pasts. A'Diao, you always dress yourself up\nLike a boy, you're more tenacious than *Ge'sang flowers.\nA'Diao, the cunning have a thousand different ways of smiling.\nWhen are you descending the mountain? Remember to bring a *Zhuo'ma knife. Under the grey brim of your hat, hollow cheeks;\nYou speak rarely, you reply simply.\nWhere will you be tomorrow? Who will even care\nif you die on the road? A'Diao, will you be able to feed yourself one full meal tomorrow?\nYou've gotten used to hunger as some sort of faith.\nA'Diao, you don't let reality smooth your edges;\nYou're not a person of this world, there's no need bother about the Truth. Destiny's contradiction-filled; obsession and indifference.\nWaved goodbye to the countless train stations of Youth,\nContent with the ordinary but discontent with mediocrity.\nYou are A'Diao—you are the bird of Freedom. Under the grey brim of your hat, hollow cheeks;\nYou speak rarely, you reply simply.\nWhere will you be tomorrow? Who will even care\nif you die on the road? Destiny's contradiction-filled; obsession and indifference.\nWaved goodbye to the countless train stations of Youth,\nContent with the ordinary but discontent with mediocrity.\nYou are A'Diao.</td>
