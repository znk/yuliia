      <td>写信告诉我今天海是什么颜色\n夜夜陪著你的海心情又如何\n灰色是不想说蓝色是忧郁\n而漂泊的你狂浪的心停在哪里 写信告诉我今夜你想要梦什么\n梦里外的我是否都让你无从选择\n我揪著一颗心整夜都闭不了眼睛\n为何你明明动了情却不敢靠近 听海哭的声音叹惜著谁又被伤了心\n却还不清醒一定不是我至少我很冷静\n可是泪水就连泪水也都不相信 听海哭的声音这片海未免也太多情\n悲泣到天明写封信给我就当最后约定\n说你在离开我的时候是怎样的心情 写信告诉我今夜你想要梦什么\n梦里外的我是否都让你无从选择\n我揪著一颗心整夜都闭不了眼睛\n为何你明明动了情却不敢靠近 听海哭的声音叹惜著谁又被伤了心\n却还不清醒一定不是我至少我很冷静\n可是泪水就连泪水也都不相信 听海哭的声音这片海未免也太多情\n悲泣到天明写封信给我就当最后约定\n说你在离开我的时候是怎样的心情</td>
      <td>Listen to the Sea Write me a letter to tell me what color the sea is today,\nThe sea that keeps you company every night, what is her mood?\nWhen she's gray she's keeps mum, when she's blue she's melancholy\nAnd you whose heart is similarly drifting, where will you stop? Write me a letter to tell me what you would like to dream of tonight\nCan you not choose between the me in your dreams and the me in real life?\nMy heart is in suspense, I stay awake all night\nWhy, after having fallen in love, do you insist on keeping your distance? Chorus Listen to the sound of the sea crying\nSighing because someone is heartbroken, and yet doesn't realize it\nThat person cannot be me, at least I am still calm\nBut my tears, even my own tears, they don't believe that Listen to the sound of the sea crying\nThe sea is too emotional, she weeps all the way until sunrise\nWrite me a letter, and let it be our last covenant\nTell me how you felt at the moment you left me</td>
