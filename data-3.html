And I'll show you where Happiness lies. If you have too much sadness, leave your heart for me to protect. The tired fireworks, I'll chase them away for you.\nFlowery words is only decorative. If I am silent, that's because I love you too much.\nLeading you by the hand. Doesn't matter how strong the wind becomes. For you have me now, you'll never lose your way again. Watching the meteor rain fall onto Earth with you. Letting your tears fall on my shoulder.\nI want you to believe my love will brave everything solely for you. And I'll show you where Happiness lies. The rain has stopped, the clouds have parted. Leaving behind a lovely warmth. I want to share the tears in your eyes. Watching the meteor rain fall onto Earth with you, Letting your tears fall on my shoulder.\nI want you to believe my love will brave everything solely for you, And I'll show you where Happiness lies.\nWatching the meteor rain fall onto Earth with you. Letting your tears fall on my shoulder.\nI want you to believe my love will brave everything solely for you. And I'll show you where Happiness lies. And I'll show you where Happiness lies.</td>

      <td>Silk-like rain stops and returns. There’s a handheld folding fan in the hands.\nThere’s the fragrance of a hundred decaying leaves. The beauty of a rose is to be admired by itself.\nInto the earth to grab ahold of lightness.\nPrecious deep thoughts gain uniformity.\nThe power of thought urges an immature heart to become mature.\nIn illusion and dream one dreams of maturing hurriedly~The circle of Taiji(yin &amp; yang) rotates by a rule~Break away from the continuous cycle from right where you are. Ah~Ah~\nSeems easy. Yet a raging fire comes through the throat.\nPaint a oil-paper flower umbrella. Compete for masks. Change the face you put on.\nAh~Ah~\nKowtow(bow) for rewards. First visit to view spring. Take the path of benevolence.\nIt’s rare in a century. To meet a friend who knows one well.\nCircle around in tiny steps to climb up the highest skies amongst clouds.\nMake circles in a futile effort to make it to the highest skies amongst clouds.\nContinue to stand there and cry by singing a song of longing.\nThoughts disturb and so look back quickly. The circle of Taiji(yin &amp; yang) rotates by a rule~Break away from the continuous cycle from right where you are. Ah~Ah~\nSeems easy. Yet a raging fire comes through the throat.\nPaint a oil-paper flower umbrella. Compete for masks. Change the face you put on.\nAh~Ah~\nKowtow(bow) for rewards. Ah~Ah~\nSeems easy. Yet a raging fire comes through the throat.\nPaint a oil-paper flower umbrella. Compete for masks. Change the face you put on.\nAh~Ah~\nKowtow(bow) for rewards. Ah~Ah~\nSeems easy.
