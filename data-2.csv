闭上眼睛
愿望是口井

你会听见真诚的回音 让我们Make a wish
Make a wish
一起约定看最美风景

Sliding down your palm
Can't hold it tight Don't be sad
It's all right
This world is still young
(Our dreams are still young) Love doesn't have wings
But it can still fly to your heart
Don't be afraid
Don't worry
Can't you sense
This love
Is so strong Will you make a wish?
Make a wish
Close your eyes
A wish is a well
Make a wish
Make a wish
You'll hear a sincere echo Let us make a wish
Make a wish
Promise together we'll see the most beautiful scenery
All this won't be a dream As long as you believe with all your heart ",embryonique,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/embryonique

In the crazy people's market
Used a counterfeit bill
To buy an illegal gun
Defending her way of life
Until the building collapsed
Night's darkness covers the North China Plain
Her face is soaked in distress At Hebei prep high school
A ping-pong playing boy faced away from me
I silently observe
Unable to leave behind the classroom
Living in past experience
Until the building collapsed.

Are running within his mind Lived this way for thirty years

坚决如铁
昏暗中有种烈日灼身的错觉
黄昏的地平线
划出一句离别
爱情进入永夜
依然记得从你眼中滑落的泪
伤心欲绝
混乱中有种热泪烧伤的错觉

割断幸福喜悦
相爱已经幻灭 ","After the whole summer,
my sadness still did not improve.
Driving my car on the vast, boundless roads,
I feel that I'm getting out of touch with myself. The song that I could not finish singing,
Left me so tired that there are rings around my eyes.
It is inevitable to get hurt in the realm of love,
No matter how beautiful the dusk is, the dark night must follow. I recall that you said, ""Goodbye""
with a tone of steel,
I had a delusion of being burnt by the sun in the darkening dusk.
The horizon at dusk,
Drew out your line of, ""Farewell.""
Love plunges into eternal night. I still remember the tears falling from your desolated eyes.
.
In the confusion, there is an illusion of being burnt by the hot tears.
The horizon at dusk,
Severed happiness and joy.
Love has already been destroyed ",pabloli,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/pabloli

After receiving a lot of these you say you don't like and leave
Don't be someone else's manipulatable puppet

It shatters and hurts
Being attacked and mocked and provoked
Emotionlessness is the best counterattack towards hurt
Being without emotion gives me courage so my heart will not fear, yeah
Nothing cannot be overcome, even if the sky collapses, love still remains
Only emotions you cannot surpass will bind you tightly
Even when the sun goes down there are lights switched on in the night
You see, this world is not bad I'm not as good as you think
yet not as bad as they imagine
You only like the the parts of me you see
You spoil me and then harshly trample on me Love is a temporary feeling
The stage lights are switched on and eventually switched off
Everyday there are people coming up and down the stage

How do you move forward
Throw away the past
Then your loved ones will not be in pain

After you fall, you must stand up again
Do not be easily defeated by your moodiness

The me who is the most introverted smiles so sociably
Onions at the bottom of a bin are like me ; Always only the seasoning in a dish
Stealthily watching you ; stealthily concealing myself If you would layer by layer
By layer peel open my heart
You would discover ; You would be surprised
You are my most repressed, most deep secret
If you would layer by layer
By layer peel open my heart
Your nose will ache ; You will tear up
So long as you can hear and see my whole heart and soul  I heard you and that person ; Have some chemistry
I with my desperation ; Am disguised very wittily
I am like an onion ; Always a supporting character
Hoping so much to have with you ; A love story for just a second If you would layer by layer

One's life is long but ephemeral
Beating heart that is vining
Willing to fight against the risk Falling in the murky abyss
As faces fully covered by dirt
Without divine halo
We hold tight the ordinarity in hands The hearts are of no regrets for the life
As the fire of life is burning One day we may be far away
Then we could meet again
No matter in crowds or at the horizon
Let me see your clear face again Indulging the tears fill my eyes
Though I'm silent and burst into tears
Don't need the divine halo
But your ordinarity Recognize the regret with broken hearts
One's life is long but ephemeral
Beating heart that is vining
Willing to fight against the risk Falling in the murky abyss

Bright lights, sounds of cars, singing and dancing

H: I look diligent

H: Those feelings are slowly obstructed,

H: I look resilient

M: The fear, the timidness, we are right here.
H: The radiance is gradually shadowed,

there's a voice that says, the laughing stock is me.
Every time I'm still willing to reach my hand out closer,
there's a shadow wrenching me in.

One step at a time
Heartbroken at every inch Thinking back to whence all began

The sound is still here

A beauty now turned old
The dream of confusing rain and green mountain is still haunts my heart
The full moon brightens the sky
My eyes got wet
A shadow crosses the clouds in the sky Again it is that full moon
I raise my wine to ask the heavens
Why does heartbreak seem like it will go on forever?
In this empty lonely room
I close shut my eyes

Yeah, a constant change in the phase of the moon is a sign
Of a chop, chop, chop in a spinning world.
Dance of tik, tok, tok lifts your veil
And lost in your ice-cold lustre.
Follow the moon, chase it, don't give up,
Run to the silvery white lines of longitude and latitude.
On a small planet washed by the tides,
Find the rhythm of your dreams. A hopeful look, you know, you know.
An endless enthusiasm, we know, we know.
Even forgotten by the whole world, I'll still exist,
Obsessed with your bright moon-like appearance (Okay!) Yeah, gimme that nectar

Dancing in the moonlight alone, alone.
Dancing forever under the moonlight.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that! The moon is pure white like a perfect dream.
The intersection of the past and the future points to you.
The position of the crescent moon in the night sky
Reflects the beauty in your eyes.
The intersecting rhythm in the dim light
Collides with the darkness of the entire world. A hopeful look, you know, you know.
An endless enthusiasm, we know, we know.
Even forgotten by the whole world, I'll still exist,

锁门关灯背对喧哗的世界
素净一张脸收敛了眉眼
锦衣夜行过春天 未完成的恋情停在回车键
还挂心的人像风筝断了线
说过的再见
也就再也没有见 笑里融的甜 泪里裹的咸
不是缘就是劫
男人追新鲜 女人求安全
不过人性弱点 开始总是深深切切心心念念你情和我愿
然后总有清清浅浅挑挑拣拣你烦和我嫌
最终总会冷冷淡淡星星点点你厌和我怨
爱风月无边引人入胜的悬念 笑里融的甜 泪里裹的咸
不是缘就是劫

然后总有清清浅浅挑挑拣拣你烦和我嫌
最终总会冷冷淡淡星星点点你厌和我怨
爱风月善变荆棘丛生的恩典 再过三五年
等事过境迁
会放下吗仍在纠结的牵连
从细枝末节
到心头余孽
摆不平的搞不定的全都交给时间 最难抵挡耳边的风眼底的月是人都难免
最难消解昨夜长风当时明月此事古难全
点了一支人去楼空缱绻事后会寂寞的烟
爱一场风月岁月里惊鸿一瞥
你就是风月 是心事的临与别 ","Took off my high heels which are both chic and tight.
Locked the door, turned off the light, my back against the noisy world.
Washed off all my makeup to look less pompous.
Put on my best clothes at night to pass the spring. I can't hit the ""Enter"" key to finish our love story.
You're like a kite cut off from its cord linked to my heart.
We said good-bye,
And we've never met again. The sweetness melted in the smile and the saltiness wrapped up in tears
Are either fate for us to fall in love or pitfalls.
Men look for fresh sensations and women rich companions.
Those are just the weaknesses in human nature. Deep affection, constant yearning for each other and shared belief in the relationship, usually found at the beginning,
Turn into reduced interaction and finding fault with each other later,
And end up as total indifference and mutual hate.
Love, the breeze and the moonlight without boundaries, is a fascinating thriller. The sweetness melted in the smile and the saltiness wrapped up in tears
Are either fate for us to fall in love or pitfalls.
Men look for fresh sensations and women rich companions.
Those are just the weaknesses in human nature. Deep affection, constant yearning for each other and shared belief in the relationship, usually found at the beginning,
Turn into reduced interaction and finding fault with each other later,
And end up as total indifference and mutual hate.
Love, the breeze and the moonlight that don't last long, is a grace strewed with thorns. After three or five years,
When everything has become the past,
Will I stop thinking about you with a muddled mind?
From every little detail
To the remnants of my heart,
I'll leave all that I can't settle to time. For any human being, the breeze beside the ears and the moonlight in the eyes are the hardest to resist.
And the breeze and the moonlight that night are always the hardest for one to forget.
I lit a cigarette in loneliess now that our romance has run its course and you're gone.
Love, the breeze and the moonlight, is a fantastic view of our life.
You're the breeze and the moonlight.
You're the one I greeted and said good-bye to. ",lakoje,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/lakoje

I’m not someone,not someone who particularly loves to make a fuss
This is called, this is called my spirit being moved
If you don’t believe me, you can ask Li Qingzhao 1 I was never someone who loved to show off,
but I had too many art cells in my body
The romances I’ve had, and dates I’ve been to, may be few
But the shots that went through me, knives that hitched me,
the sufferings I’ve had, are too gorgeous to be overlooked Why must I lose all the love in this world at least once
And be a special guest star to all the tragedy
My heart gets broken, I cry so hard, just like in a Hong Kong film
Why must I be the first to cry all the tears in the world
And be the endorser for tissues in the market
Next to me, you’re not pathetic,
this is also a kind of contribution The second you broke up with me,
I ran hysterically towards the ocean
What right have you to say that I am boring
That time you went mad in the pouring rain,
was like something taken out of cheap novel Why must I lose all the love in this world at least once
And be a special guest star to all the tragedy
My heart gets broken, I cry so hard, just like in a Hong Kong film
Why must I be the first to cry all the tears in the world
And be the endorser for tissues in the market

Apart from roaring of the engines and the electric
sounds, I seem to hear its candlewick heartbeat Here I laughed
Here I cried
Here I’ve lived
and here I’ll die
Here I prayed
Here I’ve felt lost
Here I sought
and here I’ve lost Beijing Beijing Three blocks between the coffee house and the square
Seems like the distance between the neon lights and the moon
In the midst of their struggles, people comfort and hug each other, searching and chasing, grasping at shattered dreams Here we laughed
Here we cried
Here we’ve lived
and here we’ll die
Here we prayed
Here we’ve felt lost
Here we sought
and here we’ve lost Beijing Beijing If one day I have to leave
I hope people will bury me here
Here, I can feel my existence
Here, there are too many things that I long for Here I laughed
Here I cried
Here I’ve lived
and here I’ll die
Here I prayed
Here I’ve felt lost
Here I sought
and here I’ve lost Beijing Beijing ",dammoon,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/dammoon

Keeping watch over the night sky.  I lit a solitary lamp
And quietly grow up by myself.
In the corner of my dreams
Finding comfort in the song I sing. Mama, Мama
Do you sing when you think of me?
Mama, Мama
Your star is looking for the Moon.
Mama, Мama
Don’t worry about me,
I know neither of us want to be alone. In the hustle and bustle of the world
I am a silent observer.
The story of a wanderer,
His home resides in his heart. A myriad of lights in a foreign city
All pointing to the same Moon
In a place far far away
You have always been my home. Mama, Мama

Enough or not? We’re so dope.

No longer doubt
Sphinx’s mystery cannot hold you back
Reshape each self The fire of chasing can’t be quenched
No one should hide in the corner
I don’t allow myself to hide in the corner
Getting onto stage, I show no weakness
Even if the shining lasts for only a moment
It’s worthwhile, oh yeah Look out look out look out

Panic, surprised and stunned
Thousands of arrows are sent out
Look at my eyesight killing
Watch me breaking down You have, you have

My love is extremely fragile,
So control your intensity.
Dedicate the song to the hypocrites.
Confusion is inevitable in life,
Which has matured me. Dawn is about to come; You lost sleep again for a whole night.

You don't waste the drink in your glass.

whose wings are bent by the destiny. I fell down to an abyss and my memory is locked.
This windstorm is so arrogant. Even though I am stepped again, I will not look up to others.
I will become stronger and stronger. This breath is the heat. THis heartbeat is the light.
They accumulate bit by bit and they last forever. The fire in my eyes ignite this hope
regardless of the injuries. I want to ignite my flame of fire all around
to melt the ice of people. Only if the moon knows my thoughts,
the long journey and forever darkness can't stop me. I want to reboil my flame of heart

Test out my real blood
Check all my molecules in my  DNA

Could only pray quietly
Memories last just 10 seconds
Forgotten after the revelry
Losing sense of direction again?

湖北 四川 广西 宁夏 河南
山东 贵州 云南 的小镇乡村
曾经发誓 要做了不起的人 却在 北京 上海 广州 深圳
某天夜半忽然醒来 站在寂寞的阳台
只想从这无边的寂寞中逃出来 许多年前 你有一双清澈的双眼
奔跑起来 像是一道春天的闪电
想看遍这世界 去最遥远的远方
感觉有双翅膀 能飞越高山和海洋 许多年前 你曾是个朴素的少年
爱上一个人 就不怕付出自己一生
相信爱会永恒 相信每个陌生人
相信你会成为最想成为的人 习惯说谎 就是变成熟了吗
有一套房子之后 才能去爱别人吗
总是以为成功之后 就能抚平伤痕
欲望边 埋着错过的人
当青春耗尽 只剩面目可憎 你我来自
湖北 四川 广西 宁夏 河南
山东 贵州 云南 的小镇乡村
曾经发誓 要做了不起的人 却在北京 上海 广州 深圳
某天夜半忽然醒来 像被命运叫醒了
它说你不能就这样过完一生 许多年前 你有一双清澈的双眼
奔跑起来 像是一道春天的闪电
想看遍这世界 去最遥远的远方
感觉有双翅膀 能飞越高山和海洋 许多年前 我曾是个朴素的少年
爱上一个人 就不怕付出自己一生
相信爱会永恒 相信每个陌生人
当我和世界初相见 当我曾经是少年 ","Sometimes you would miss the past days
But when you really left you didn't even say a word
You only waved your hand, like throwing away wastepaper
Saying it is an inevitable thing in life
Drinking until one almost become drunk but you could still feel a sense of loss In the mirror it seems like you can see the end of life
Perhaps after a few years you will also become a hypocrite
Is it really because of this that we have come to this world?
This question we won't have time to think it through
And days and years have already passed You and me come from
towns and villages in Hubei, Si Chuan, Guang Xi, Ning Xia, He Nan, Shan Dong, Gui Zhou and Yun Nan
We have sworn before to become great people But in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shen Zhen
we would suddenly wake up someday in the middle of the night and stand on a lonely balcony
Only wanting to escape from this endless loneliness Several years ago you had a pair of pure eyes
When you started to run you looked like lightning in spring
Wanting to see the whole world, going to the furthest place
Feeling like you had a pair of wings so you could cross high mountains and oceans Several years ago you were once a simple youngster
When you had fallen in love with someone you wouldn't be afraid to put your whole life into it
Believing that love will last forever, believing in every stranger
Believing that you will become the person you want to become the most Getting used to telling lies does that mean you have become mature?
After owning a house is that when you can love someone?
Always thinking after becoming successful wounds would be able to heal
Longing after people that you have missed out and buried in your heart
Once your youth is up what is left is only your hateful appearance You and me come from
towns and villages in Hubei, Si Chuan, Guang Xi, Ning Xia, He Nan, Shan Dong, Gui Zhou and Yun Nan
We have sworn before to become great people But in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shen Zhen
we would suddenly wake up someday in the middle of the night as if being woken up by fate
Saying to you that you can't let your life just pass like this Several years ago you had a pair of pure eyes
When you started to run you looked like lightning in spring
Wanting to see the whole world, going to the furthest place
Feeling like you had a pair of wings so you could cross high mountains and oceans Several years ago I was once a simple youngster
When you had fallen in love with someone you wouldn't be afraid to put your whole life into it
Believing that love will last forever, believing in every stranger
That was the time when I met the world The time when I was still a youngster ",PrinceFinn,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/princefinn

Bright day, dwelling in the wind
Me and my sword, one edge implies the Jianghu
Jianghu is where I am from Rap: At first skill is quite ordinary
And no care much about it
Bending the sword to carry the falling flower,
a little bit displeased
Blame the flower or person,
blame the sword too slow unable to call back
Blame on the young age, being mindless
Haven't fulfill the learning,
ambition comes to embody all the landscape  Practicing sword by Chen Jian lake,
under the reflection of stars
Simulate Qi as a long sail,
sending me to the all streams
It's the frost that is no cooler than the blade point
It's the edge which ignites the turbulent days
Around the Chen Jian lake,
suddenly hear a light sigh Dark night, think of fighting bathing in the moonlight
Bright day, pour out (the words) in the wind
Me and my sword, thousand times
we have made the list in Jianghu
Jianghu is still our home Dark night, part the mist in the moonlight
Bright day, raise the dust in the wind
Me and my sword, thousand times
We have made the list in Jianghu Around the Chen Jian lake,
Day and night have become the routine
Be satisfied, but to conform to the nature
The falling flower doesn't fall
and the sword trembles once
Right and wrong can be judged by a single sword
Around the Chen Jian lake,
pay respects to all shouts and screaming Dark night, good for boating in the moonlight
(Zhanlu has no edge and is awesome)
(Chunjun is pure and noble)
Bright day, dwelling in the wind
(Juque is thick and heavy, can make a hole in a cauldron and broken a jar)
(Shengxie portraits the evil and forces (someone) inch by inch)
Me and my sword, one edge implies the Jianghu
(Yuchang is brave and makes the enemies no return)
(Chengying is elegant and conserved, can absorb the essence of nature)
(Chixiao chop off the snake)
Jianghu is where I am from
(Gan Jiang and Mo Ye won't be apart) Dark night, think of fighting bathing in the moonlight
Bright day, pour out (the words) in the wind
Me and my sword, thousand times
we have made the list in Jianghu Liuxingbaiyu precious box is revealed
(Being a good man, fighting against the setting sun, ice and snow)
(Three clouds left behind)
The long route is spread in ambiguous roads
(A thousand miles, a narrow road, a difficult geese, over the Qinchuan)
Take it light when you go
(Self-satisfied and independent, the shadow will be lonely but clear and bright)
(Being free is a priority)
A sword carries me through the ancient times
(Cover up the clouds and throw away the fame and gain)
the ancient times Dark night, tired under the moon
Bright day, being at leisure in the wind
Me and my sword, thousand times
we have made the list in Jianghu
Why is it my home?
A cup of alcohol is not full, pour fully by the dream
Ambition is realized to re-begin the long journey
(The sword can be favored by the god for its reputation)
The pool will not be dried, keep in silence
and have seen the mud become sediment and be turbid
(Know what it is and honor its wishes)
(The sword hasn't sank in the Chen Jian lake and my heart is still afraid) ",Sebas_WangYibo_fan,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/sebaswangyibofan

Waiting for me to answer the reason why I appeared

So he turned and headed towards the hills
He understood, he understood I could not give
So he turned and headed towards the ocean
I listened to the lad’s voice in a time before the future
Hungering for a happy ending but was not able to fulfill it
But was not able to fulfill it
He understood, he understood I could not give
So he turned and headed towards the hills
He understood, he understood I could not give
So he turned and headed towards the ocean
Sun shining on top of my head , is it applauding or criticizing
Heart destroyed by blazing fire has return from ashes to become stronger
Ocean covered with oil slicks are what’s left of my dignity
The residuals of a climax turns around to gaze
Fantasies of misunderstood innocence knits its path at night
When candlelight overtakes darkness, do you hide or not hide
Even stormy waves and looming clouds can not defeat the searching soul
What I long for is far far away awaiting for the echo to return
The battle I am fighting with myself can not win back the calm and serenity
Although worldliness covers the innocence, he fights to tear off the insincere mask
Turns around to look at the past telling it to blame the uncertainty of life
He understood, he understood I could not give
So he turned and headed towards the hills
He understood, he understood I could not give

All hold it in the palm But then I hold tighter
But then I love greed more and more
But then I love till the arrow pierces through my heart

擦干泪　不要怕　至少我们还有梦
他说　风雨中　这点痛算什么
擦干泪　不要问　为什么 长大以后　为了理想而努力
渐渐的忽略了父亲　母亲和故乡的消息
如今的我　生活就像在演戏
说著言不由衷的话　戴着伪善的面具 总是拿着微不足道的成就来骗自己
总是莫名奇妙感到一阵的空虚
总是靠一点酒精的麻醉才能够睡去
在半睡半醒之间仿佛又听见水手说 他说　风雨中　这点痛算什么
擦干泪　不要怕　至少我们还有梦
他说　风雨中　这点痛算什么
擦干泪　不要问　为什么 寻寻觅觅寻不到活着的证据
都市的柏油路太硬踩不出足迹
骄傲无知的现代人不知道珍惜
那一片被文明糟踏过的海洋和天地 只有远离人群才能找回我自己
在带着咸味的空气中自由的呼吸
耳畔又传来汽笛声和水手的笑语
永远在内心的最深处听见水手说 他说　风雨中　这点痛算什么
擦干泪　不要怕　至少我们还有梦
他说　风雨中　这点痛算什么
擦干泪　不要问　为什么 ","The feeling of bitter sand blowing painfully against the face
Like father's scolding and mother's crying, can never forget
When I was young I loved to go alone to the seashore
Roll up my pants and walk barefoot on the sand Always dreaming of a magical world at the end of the sea
Always admiring the intrepid sailor as a true man
Always weak and fearing the winds like a coward
Whenever I was bullied I would hear the sailor say He said over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears, don't be afraid, at least we still have our dreams
He said over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears and don't question why When I grew up I worked hard for my future
Gradually growing distant from father, mother, and home
As of today my life is like a performance
Speaking insincere words wearing a mask of hypocrisy Always using some insignificant success to justify myself
Always inexplicably feeling an emptiness inside
Always relying on the solace of drink to fall asleep
Half-sleeping half-waking, I hear the sailor say He says over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears, don't be afraid, at least we still have our dreams
He says over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears and don't question why Searching, searching for proof that I'm alive
This city's paved roads are too thick, I can't leave my footprints
Ignorant and proud, the modern man doesn't know to appreciate
The seas, skies, and earth ravaged by civilization Only far away from the crowd can I find myself again
In this salty air I am unable to breathe
In my ear the steam whistle sounds and the sailor says with a chuckle
Forever in the depths of my heart the sailor says He says over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears, don't be afraid, at least we still have our dreams
He says over the wind and the waves, endure the pain
Dry your tears and don't question why ",jhan,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/jhan

In the silence.
It is more painful than a wound.
Don't turn around,
Please wait and listen to me. If you let me get rid of the pain, then,
Perhaps, without excuses, our mistakes will lead to different results.
So let me stop crying.
Can we stay happy? More than anything else, I'm afraid to stay with nothing,
To be fail to find reasons to touch you again.
It's too empty like the night sky above the city.

That the rain was beginning to subside.
I really wanted to get soaked by the rain again.
Everytime I felt my courage fading, I still stayed
I really wanted to ask you one more time,
Would you have stayed or would you have left? On that windy day,
I tried to hold your hand.
But eveytime,
the rain came,
It was so heavy that I couldn’t see you.
How long do I have to wait,
Before I can be by your side.
I’m waiting for the day the skies begin to clear,
Then maybe I would feel a little bit better.
Once upon a time,
There was a person who loved you for very long.
But everytime,
the wind blew,
It blew us further apart.
It really wasn’t easy,
To continue loving you for another day.

Misty flagstone road, father whispering
Realize in desperation that it has to be more cruel
All is for the path leading to chapel
The mist that would not scatter hides the intention
Who has been pacing gently and stopped
The bullet that penetrates takes the warmness away before men cry Each of us is sinful
A variety of sins
I can decide who should be right
While who else is to have an eternal sleep
Debates contribute to no solution
At the endless night
To shut up
As the sole mercy Each one in the way is sinful
There's no turning back for regrets
Judge in the name of the father
There seems no proper word
It's like smiling while shedding tears
Gazing at pure darkness
Tragedies those prevent tragedies from spreading intoxicate me Bend their heads and kiss my left hand
In exchange for promises of forgiveness
Old organ in the corner
Accompanies on and on and on
Wind shakes the black curtains
With sunlight penetrating in silence
Onto those beasts tamed by me Cry out in silence, cry out in silence
Solitude begins to ferment
Laughing at me all the time
Reminiscence gradually burn
Those scenes of innocence once
Appear cruelly and gently
Tiime for fragility
Let's pray together Father of mercy, I have fallen
Into the state of invisible sins
Please forgive me for my vainglory
There's no one to talk to, with no one I can talk to
It's so difficult to stand this
Solitude is carved on the back of glory With my eyes closed I see again
The scene of that dream back then
With the sky hazy and misty
Father leading me by the hand
Walked gently
On the flagstone road quiet in early morning Bend their heads and kiss my left hand
In exchange for promises of forgiveness
Old organ in the corner
Accompanies on and on and on
Wind shakes the black curtains
With sunlight penetrating in silence
Onto those beasts tamed by me Cry out in silence, cry out in silence

Laughing at me all the time

Please forgive me for my vainglory
There's no one to talk to, with no one I can talk to

Solitude is carved on the back of glory I have been wiping our mottled heraldry for a whole night
Glory in solitude, such a feeling that only I can feel
Candle light shaking nonstop
An owl on the window lattice, overlooking into the distance
The gallery leading to the hall
Has seen the same vicissitudes
No clamour, but tranquillity surrounding

But it turns out that to you, any Asian girl is OK
She's got long black hair and a C cup chest
If you don't go hit on her, you can't stand it A serious case of yellow fever
Preferring Asian lovers
You clearly already have me
So what are you still planning on doing? The thing I can't stand the most is when you show
Your sparkling smile and bright white teeth
Thinking you're so handsome, and quickly

The radar goes beep beep and it's locked on target

your romantic passion is hopeless
but it leads me through a wonderful journey An unstoppable sun.no matter how I try to resist
it spreads through the darkest place in my chest
forcing me to release all my shadows
after slowly thawing the heart, my heart boils An unstoppable sun warms my eyes
learning me gently about understanding and forgiving
pushing down my gray walls
your colors make my days sunny and let me dream again Opening a misunderstanding is like opening a window
it lets you see my true self
unyielding on the outside, disoriented inside the heart

When should we begin to admit out loneliness
Despairing silence and emotional admittances
Are not lifelines, but rather helplessness Happiness crashes down from its highest peak
Memories burst into flames
You and I no longer exist in the same universe
Can take away pain, but cannot take away feelings
Was once unafraid of losing all; having each other was all that mattered
Can take away time, but cannot take away old dreams
Only fighting for you
Makes me understand how to forget my feelings Pretending to be cold, hiding all the pain
Are just desires that could be rationalized
The person you care about the most can hurt you the most
Because love still exists, I have sunk into a storm of emotions Happiness crashes down from its highest peak
Memories burst into flames
You and I no longer exist in the same universe
Can take away pain, but cannot take away feelings
Was once unafraid of losing all; having each other was all that mattered
Can take away time, but cannot take away old dreams
Only fighting for you
Makes me understand how to forget my feelings Love is violence mixed with insanity
The more you love, the more you understand Can take away pain, but cannot take away feelings
Was once unafraid of losing all; having each other was all that mattered
Can take away time, but cannot take away old dreams
Only fighting for you

Screaming

Frost spreads with the passing of time
Emperor’s Smile to dispel worries
This persistent tipsiness began under the moonlight I stroke the guqin to pour my grief in the notes of Inquiry
I have basked in your warmth
Yet time hastens forward, stopping for no one
I would spend a lifetime of waiting in exchange of a single glance back from you
As I wake from this dream, I do not want to be left with nothing As I miss the old days, that tipsiness lingers
A recurrent dream in Gusu across the years
Emperor’s Smile to dispel worries
This persistent tipness began under the moonlight I stroke the guqin to pour my grief in the notes of Inquiry
I have basked in your warmth
Yet time hastens forward, stopping for no one
I would spend a lifetime of waiting, longing for a single glance back from you
As I wake from this dream, I do not want to be left with nothing Youthful memories brimming with silent warmth accompany my vigil
I keep wishing I could hold your hand, just once more I would spend a lifetime watching over you, longing for a single glance back from you
I play a song to reminisce the past with you beyond the afterlife
I would spend a lifetime watching over you in exchange of a single glance back from you

你的目光中坚定而温柔
像对我诉说 等我 为你坠落
坠落 燃起爱情的花火
火花颤动 再绚烂都不过沉默
沉默 无声坠落
坠落 落入爱情的怀中
只为承诺 你会牢牢拥抱我
连眼泪也不放过
别让我像放手后的沙随风漂流
我会紧紧拥抱你
像宇宙张开双手
多希望能在你的身边 我一直都在这守候
未曾变过
像亿万年前那一颗星球
依旧在闪烁 ","I have always been here, waiting and watching over

 Like that planet from millions of years ago
 Still glimmering as before
 You're never given up waiting for me
 Gaze sweeping the entire starry sky
 Your stare is firm and tender
 As if it's telling me   (Wait for me) I will fall for you
 (Falling) Set off the fireworks of love
 (Sparks flying) Can't beat silence, no matter how dazzling it may be
 (Silence) Silently falling
 (Falling)  Falling into love embrace
 (Just because of promises)   You will firmly embrace me
 Won't ever spare my tears
 Don't let be carried by the wind like sand that has been released
 I will embrace you tightly
 Like the universe opening its arms
 Even if I'm not by your side You're never given up waiting for me
 Gaze sweeping the entire starry sky

It's painful, lonely and somehow exhausting
I don't let other people enter my zero degree zone

Then they break free from the past and forget everything
I didn't think my ending would suddenly change
Who will be able to grab my powerless arms? How can I cry again
Who's wrong, who's right, whom should I apologize to
I can't cry again
Who's wrong, who's right, whom should I worry for1 Running into the zero degree zone waiting for everything to fall apart
Even if love is dangerous we will face it together
It'll be too late to protect the promises we didn't hear
So how do you want me to learn about tomorrow full of love Escaping from the zero degree zone, finally everything falls apart
Even if love is exhausting, I won't regret it
I put down my defense and everything doesn't matter
I ran away of the dark world and start a new tomorrow A new tomorrow Running out of the zero degree zone, finally everything falls apart
Even if love is exhausting, I won't regret it

梦里外的我是否都让你无从选择
我揪著一颗心整夜都闭不了眼睛
为何你明明动了情却不敢靠近 听海哭的声音叹惜著谁又被伤了心
却还不清醒一定不是我至少我很冷静
可是泪水就连泪水也都不相信 听海哭的声音这片海未免也太多情
悲泣到天明写封信给我就当最后约定
说你在离开我的时候是怎样的心情 ","Listen to the Sea Write me a letter to tell me what color the sea is today,
The sea that keeps you company every night, what is her mood?
When she's gray she's keeps mum, when she's blue she's melancholy
And you whose heart is similarly drifting, where will you stop? Write me a letter to tell me what you would like to dream of tonight
Can you not choose between the me in your dreams and the me in real life?
My heart is in suspense, I stay awake all night
Why, after having fallen in love, do you insist on keeping your distance? Chorus Listen to the sound of the sea crying
Sighing because someone is heartbroken, and yet doesn't realize it
That person cannot be me, at least I am still calm
But my tears, even my own tears, they don't believe that Listen to the sound of the sea crying
The sea is too emotional, she weeps all the way until sunrise
Write me a letter, and let it be our last covenant
Tell me how you felt at the moment you left me ",anotherguest,https://lyricstranslate.com/en/translator/anotherguest

Fragrant, beautiful, the stem full of buds
Fragrant and white, everyone praises
Let me pluck you
To offer you to someone else
