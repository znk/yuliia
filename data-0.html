However, I'm helpless.\nThe result has long been known:\nYou just wanna leave me, ye. Tell me to leave you alone and that you're regret. But I...\nCan you give me a chance? But you\nMake me hysterical. I feel like I'm heartbroken, oh wu.\nYou are gone, and my world has fallen into the abyss.\nI no longer have a sense of time.\nAnd I haven't had time to say goodbye.\nI always feel that I should apologize to you for the last time.\nAw nah ye But after that, she is no longer by my side, ye.\nAre you scared without me?\nNahnah yeye Is it possible to return to former youth? The first snow whirls in the frosty wind.\nCan you give me another chance to start all over again?\nNow he is intoxicated by the smile of a beautiful woman,\nAs if he had just woken up from a dream and forgot everything. I don't wanna talk. I don't wanna hide anything.\nI never wanna get out of your world.\nEven if there will be many other wanderers\nI don't wanna leave your world.</td>

How long are these three lives?\nHolding hands till the end of life  The desolate wind, the infinite fog, rain is falling, snow is dwindling\nStep by step accompanying you\nHolding hands, do not be afraid, not caring about tomorrow\nWho is afraid of the wandering destiny? Who is afraid of the ends of the Earth? Listening to the sounds of the rustling wind\nKnocking against whose melancholy\nThe yearning feeling is growing at an instant\nForgetting how long the night The tear holding in [my] palm is burning hot\nOnly willing to be crazy for you in three lifetimes\nFallen flowers through the sky, and hearing the piano sounds again\nWandering through Heaven and Earth with you If love is too desolate, I will dream with you\nTo redeem all your tears\nHow far is this road?

The wind stopped, the fog dissipated. The rain still, the snow melted.\nGoodbye the perfectly beautiful moonlight, I am still by your side</td>
